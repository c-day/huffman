There's a road that I remember leading to a special place Where the door was always open to a smiling face There's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me It's always the same, there's a stocking with my name And a candle in the window, a flame against the night There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are Just a candle in the window Maybe it's just wishful thiking I can hear the sleigh bells ring Almost taste teh pie she's baking, it's Christmas Eve And there's a candle in the window, a flame against the night The candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go There's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart

I was walkin'home from school On a cold winter day, Took a short cut through the woods And I lost my way. It was gettin' late, and I was scared and alone. Then a kind old man took my hand, and led me home. Mama couldn't see him, But he was standing there, And I knew in my heart He was the answer to my prayer. [Chorus]Oh, I believe there are Angels Among Us, Sent down to us from somewhere up above. They come to you and me in our darkest hours To show us how to live To teach us how to give To guide us with a light of love. When life held troubled times And had me down on my knees There's always been someone To come along and comfort me A kind word from a stranger To lend a helping hand A phone call from a friend Just to say I understand Now ain't it kind of funny At the dark end of the road Someone light the way with just a single ray of hope. [Chorus] They wear so many faces, Show up in the strangest places And grace us with their mercies in our time of need. [Chorus]To guide us with a light of love

They married back in '32They were young and love was newAnd every day the feeling grewBetween the two of themWhen work grew scarce and times got badThe hope would chase away the sadAnd hope was sometimes all they hadBetween the two of themThe 40's came and the 50's wentAnd the mortgage replaced the rentThey made the most of each day spentBetween the two of themTheir children all turned out just fineSo he retired in '69And left with oh so little timeBetween the two of themToday I brave the graveyard rainAnd placed a rose between their namesNow that's the most that ever cameBetween the two of themAnd though I miss them oh so muchHis crooked smile her gentle touchAnd the pleasure of just growing upBetween the two of them
In a cloud of dust cross Texas, south of San AntoneThe lawman and the cowboy pushed their horses onRacin' toward the Rio running out of timeThey had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline.Well, the lawman wanted justice the cowboy revengeThey tracked the Outlaws' horses up to the river's edgeAnd there across the Rio a badge ain't worth a dimeThe law was in their own hands once they crossed the borderline.So they ride to the desert wind down a dusty trail, destiny beginsHeroes never turn or look backThey just ride through the sands of time on the borderlineIn the safety of the badlands the outlaws stopped their runThe campfire rings with laughter of evil things they've doneHow they'd taken all they wanted and killed the cowboy's wifeAnd knew no one would follow them, cross the borderline.The lawman and the cowboys stepped out of the darkAnd it was two against the twenty and every bullet found its markAnd so goes the legend that out there in the nightThe two still ride together somewhere beyond the borderline.So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny beginsHeroes never turn or look backThey just ride through the sands of time on the borderline.They ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny beginsHeroes never turn or look back.They ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny beginsHeroes never turn or look back
Clear creeks and cool mountain mornin's. Honest work out in the fields. Cornbread in my momma's kitchen. Daddy saying grace before the meal. Family ties run deep in this land. And I'm never very far from what I am. [Chorus] I was born country and that's what I'll always be. Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free. I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood. I was born country and this country's what I love. Moonlight and you hear beside me. Crickets serenadin' in the yard. What more could two people ask for. Laying here in love beneath the stars. Now this is where I want to raise my kids. Just the way my mom and daddy did. [Chorus: x2] I was born country
Atlanta was on fire and so was she the night he left her.  Left her there to bear her pain alone, hoping soon to return.  Burn, Georgia, burn.  The roaring of th guns filled the emptiness inside her where once she felt  the pounding of her heart.  When he held her in his arms, tenderness they learned.  Burn, Georgia, burn.  He was the body, she was the soul of a love affair the couldn't control.  While the world was falling down around them, they were not concerned.  Burn, Georgia, burn.  Winter brought the snow and a rider down from Franklin with news of how the  war had taken toll and he would not return.  Burn, Georgia, burn.  He was the body, she was the soul of a love affair they couldn't control.  While her world crumbled all around her, she was not concerned.  Burn, Georgia, burn.  While strolling through her mind she stumbled on an old, familiar feeling of  how he touched her many years ago and how he made her yearn.  Burn, Georgia, burn

Long hair was not in style the first time I heard Haggard on the radio, but I could feel the changes comin' on. The Beatles crossed the ocean, an overnight explosion on the T.V. My brother had to go to Vietnam. Ford unveiled the Mustang. Things were good in Detroit for the people there. And I could feel changes comin' on. From Atlanta Doctor King told the world he had a dream. People followed him. And Daddy said my hair was getting long. I could feel changes comin' on. People started singin' different songs, searchin' for the place where they belong. I could feel changes comin' on. Well, I'm still hooked on Haggard. But the Beatles can't come back like we hoped they would. In Memphis, Tennessee, The King is gone. As I put my kids to bed, I wonder what lies ahead for them to see, 'cause I can feel the changes comin' on. I could feel changes comin' on. People stilll are singin' different songs. They're searchin' for the place where they belong. I can feel changes comin' on. I can feel changes comin' on. I can feel changes comin' on.

It's a miracle Your love is like a river, peaceful and deepYour soul is like a secret that I never could keepWhen I look into your eyes, I know that it's trueGod must have spent a little more time on you(A little more time....I'm sure he did....yes he did, babe...) In all of creation, all things great and smallYou are the one that surpasses them allMore precious than any diamond or pearlThey broke the mold when you came in this worldAnd I'm trying hard to figure out...just how I ever did withoutThe warmth of your smile, the heart of a childThat's deep inside, it leaves me purified Your love is like a river, peaceful and deepYour soul is like a secret that I never could keepWhen I look into your eyes, I know that it's trueGod must have spent a little more time on you God must have spent a little more time on youYouOn youA little more time on you

We didn't know the times were lean,Round our house the grass was green,It didn't seem like things were all that bad,I bet we walked a thousand miles,Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,And learnin' how to give it all we had.As Life went on and years went by,I saw the light in daddy's eye,And felt the love in mamma's hands,They kept us warm and kept us fed,Taught us how to look ahead,Now lookin' back I understand.We were walkin' in high cotton,Old times there are not forgotten,Those fertile fields are never far away,We were walkin' in high cotton,Old time there are not forgotten,Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.When Sunday mornings rolled around,We dressed up hand-me-downs,Just in time to gather with the church,Some times I think how long It's been,And how it impressed me then,It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.We were walkin' in high cotton,Old times there are not forgotten,Those fertile fields are never far away,We were walkin' in high cotton,Old time there are not forgotten,Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.We were walkin' in high cotton,Old times there are not forgotten,Those fertile fields are never far away,We were walkin' in high cotton,Old time there are not forgotten,Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.We were walkin' in high cotton,Old times there are not forgotten,Those fertile fields are never far away,We were walkin' in high cotton,Old time there are not forgotten,Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.Walkin' in High Cotton
Why should I feel discouraged?And why should the shadows come?And why should my heart be lonelyAnd long for heaven and home?When Jesus is my portionMy constant friend is HeHis eye is on the sparrowAnd I know He watches meAnd I sing because I'm happyI sing because I am freeHis eye is on the sparrowAnd I know He watches meLet not your heart be troubledHis tender word I hearAnd resting on His goodnessI lose my doubts and fearsThough by the path He leads usBut one step I may seeHis eye is on the sparrowsAnd I know He watches meAnd I sing because I'm happyAnd I sing because I'm freeHis eye is on the sparrowAnd I know He watches meHis eye is on the sparrowAnd I know He watches me
Atlanta, Georgia made her the Cotton QueenL.A. bound she had visions of the silver screenBut Hollywood ain't nothin' but glamor and lights To a blue-eyed blond with stars in her eyesHer days are long. Lord, her nights are longer yetTryin' to find a part that will make her the Queen of sexShe's realizing what it's all about from too many nights upon the casting couch[Chorus:]Hollywood: parties and thrillsThe mansion in her mind is somewhere is Beverly HillsShe's been discovered too many times standing on the corner of Hollywood and VineShe makes her entrance now a days through the swingin' doorsShe found her stage on a hardwood barroom floorBut it's not the bottom, just part of a long, hard fallHer biggest fan's the man. Tonight she'll give her allThe dream is dyin' of her name on the marqueeThe folks back home wonder what happened to their QueenThe mornin' papers told it in black and white, calling it another Hollywood suicide[Chorus:]
A glowin' fire and fallin' snow, they spark a memoryStockings hangin', mistletoe, presents beneath a treeA happy boy wakin' up to toys, lookin' so surprisedAnd wondering how Santa knew just when I closed my eyesChorus:It's a Homecoming Christmas, goin' back to where it all beganHomecoming Christmas, I wanna be there once againMemories do sweet and strong and I've been done too longIt's Christmas time and I'm comin' homeI can see the Christmas tree and feel the warm fireplaceHandmade decorations, homemade pies and cakesFamily all together with so much love to shareA special time and I can't wait, can't wait to be thereChorus

When I was a lad and old Shep was a pupOver hills and meadows we'd strayJust a boy and his dog, we were both full of funWe grew up together that wayI remember the time at the old mill pondWhen I would've drowned beyond doubtBut old Shep was right there, to the rescue he cameHe jumped in and helped pull me outAs, the years passed and rolled, at last he grew oldAnd his eyesight was fast growing dim.Then one day the doctor looked at me and saidI can't do no more for him, Jim?I went to his side and sat on the groundAnd laid his old head on my kneeWell, he was the best friend that I ever hadI cried so I scarcely could seeOld Sheppie he knew, he was going to goFor he reached out and licked at my handHe looked up at me, just as much as to sayWe're parting but you understandNow old Sheppie is gone where the good doggies goAnd no more with old Shep will I roamBut if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing for sureOld Shep has a wonderful home
Some folks looks through a telescopeAnd dream of flying high above the starsThey say it won't be long'Til we can haul on a ship to MarsI'm just a simple manThere's a lot that I don't knowBut as long as you're here with meI just assume stay homeOn this side of the moonThings are going my wayYour love keeps shining throughEven when it rainsThere's nowhere else I'd rather beI'm happy standing in these shoesWith you here in my lifeThe world is looking brightOn this side of the moonSometimes on a clear nightWe pulled out a chair in the yardAnd I'm always amazedAt the good lord can make so many starsBut I know I'd feel out of placeLonging through the milky waysAll you expect a astronautI'd think I'd rather stayOn this side of the moonThings are going my wayYour love keeps shining throughEven when it rainsThere's nowhere else I'd rather beI'm happy standing in these shoesWith you here in my lifeThe world is looking brightOn this side of the moon
Once upon a lifetimeI looked in someone's eyesAnd felt the fire burning in my heartFor the very first timeShe was scared and youngAnd had never tasted loveSo I took her by the handAnd a boy became a manOnce upon a lifetimeAnd once upon a lifetimeYou hold the Queen of HeartsAnd if you gamble on a diamond winThe dealin' startsYou stand to lose it allAs the cards begin to fallAnd the lesson learned is hardYou're only dealt the Queen of CardsOnce upon a lifetimeSo if you're taking chances, know the chance you takeA broken heart's a high price to payFoolish ways will make fools of the wiseAnd the best things seldom come along twiceOnce upon a lifetimeYou know that you've been blessedWhen you hold your first born tenderly against your chestAnd through the innocence you seeThe value of a familyAnd you feel a special bondThat only comes alongOnce upon a lifetimeSo if you're taking chances, know the chance you takeA broken heart's a high price to payFoolish ways will make fools of the wiseAnd the best things seldom come along twiceAnd people only find love like yours and mineOnce upon a lifetime

I was taught to believe and never to doubt the man up above knows what he's talkin' about.So, when I heard that voice, so loud and clear, speak to my heart, I knew that she must be near.The Maker said take her and love her forever, take care of her for life and treat her right. I never was the one to listen very well.I walked my own way and felt what I felt, further out of touch with the master plan, but she was like a flight to the Promised Land.The Maker said take her and love her forever, take care of her for lifeNever forsake her, don't be a heart breaker. The Maker said take her and treat her right, just treat her right. He placed an angel in the palm of my hands.And for once in my life, I obeyed His commands.I'll take her and love her forever, take care of her for life.Ooh, never forsake her, don't be a heart breaker.The Maker said take her and treat her right, just treat her right.Ooh, just treat her right.The Maker said take her and love her forever, take care of her for lifeNever forsake her, don't be a heart breaker. The Maker said take her and treat her right, treat her right.For life.

I got her in my heart and I got her in my head.I got her in love and I got her in bed.I got her thank for all I own.If it wasn't for her love, I'd be all alone.Chorus:She's my woman back home that treats me right, early in the mornin' to lateAt night.It doesn't really matter. Any time's all right.Wish my woman back home was here tonight to hold me tight.Thinkin' 'bout her now in my hotel room.I'm wonderin' when and I'm hopin' it's soon.I see her smile and her eyes are green.She's the prettiest girl my eyes have ever seen.Chorus
It's almost summer you know and I can't wait to goDiggin' my toes in the sandSpendin' long summer days soakin' up some raysTo the sound of a reggae bandMy baby looks so good but I knew she wouldAnd I'm so glad she's mineI'm gonna kiss her again while the waves roll inIt's just a wonderful waste of timeOh, put all our cares  behind usWrapped in each others arms is where you'll find usKickin' back on a beach with my lover in reachHoldin' her hand in mineCrazy things that we do may not matter to youIt's just a wonderful waste of timeOh, we're dancin' a hole to ChinaEven though we're on a beach in CarolinaOh, moonlight walks by the oceanOh, there's no need to control our emotionsI want to tell you my friend I'd like to do it againThere's no reason or rhymeSpendin' time on the shore, I'd like to do it some moreIt's just a wonderful waste of timeYes, it's just a wonderful waste of time, just a wonderful waste of timeA wonderful waste of time, it's a wonderful waste of time A wonderful waste of time, a wonderful waste of time A wonderful waste of time, a wonderful waste of time
Just like a western movie, a challenge has been made.A shot was fired in anger, and pride stepped off the train.Won't we ever stop this killin', me and you, till our hearts are up on boot hill and there's nothing we can do? Words at twenty paces, anger at high noon.This house ain't big enough for both of us. it's comin' soon.We'll finish off our happiness and run hope out of town.With words at twenty paces, lord, it's love we're gunnin' down.How did we ever lose the dreams we used to share, the gentle touch, the words of love, the way we used to care? Sometimes you words cut like a bullet in my side.Oh, which is more important, wounded hearts or wounded pride? I've got my ammunition. I know you've got yours too.We know each other's weakness; lord, the damage we can do.Why can't we just step aside and put our guns away? Let love come like the cavalry: ride in and save the day? Words at twenty paces, anger at high noon.This house ain't big enough for both of us. it's comin' soon.We'll finish off our happiness and run hope out of town.With words at twenty paces, lord, it's love we're gunnin' down.
