Rollermeaning car would seem to me to make more sense interms of this song which involves a woman leaving andin terms of the title which may refer to the year ofthe car." Thanks To Chris Schell;Note 2: the farm of Will Dockery, in Patton's nativetown Dockery, a Delta plantation town;This is another familiar Delta piece. Robert Johnsonused the same melody in "If I had Possession OverJudgment Day" and "Traveling Riverside Blues". It hasalso been recorded under the title "Roll And TumbleBlues". Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf have issuedversions of this as well.
