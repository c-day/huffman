Bows and flows of angel hairAnd ice cream castles in the airAnd feather canyons everywhereI've looked at clouds that wayBut now they only block the sunThey rain and snow on everyoneSo many things I would have doneBut clouds got in my wayI've looked at clouds from both sides nowFrom up and down, and still somehowIt's cloud illusions I recallI really don't know clouds at allMoons and Junes and Ferris wheelsThe dizzy dancing way you feelAs every fairy tale comes realI've looked at love that wayBut now it's just another showYou leave 'em laughing when you goAnd if you care, don't let them knowDon't give yourself awayI've looked at love from both sides nowFrom give and take, and still somehowIt's love's illusions I recallI really don't know love at allTears and fears and feeling proudTo say "I love you" right out loudDreams and schemes and circus crowdsI've looked at life that wayOh but now old friends are acting strangeThey shake their heads, they say I've changedWell something's lost but something's gainedIn living every dayI've looked at life from both sides nowFrom win and lose and still somehowIt's life's illusions I recallI really don't know life at allI've looked at life from both sides nowFrom up and down and still somehowIt's life's illusions I recallI really don't know life at all

And so weve had another nightOf poetry and poses,And each man knows hell be aloneWhen the sacred ginmill closes.And so well drink the final glassEach to his joy and sorrowAnd hope the numbing drink will lastTil opening tomorrow.And when we stumble back againLike paralytic dancersEach knows the question he must askAnd each man knows the answer.And so well drink the final drinkthat cuts the brain in sectionsWhere answers do not signifyAnd there arent any questions.I broke my heart the other day.It will mend again tomorrow.If Id been drunk when I was bornId be ignorant of sorrow.And so well drink the final toastThat never can be spoken:Heres to the heart that is wise enoughTo know when its better off broken.
I want to go back to my little grass shackIn Kealakekua, HawaiiI want to be with all the kanes and wahinesThat I used to know long ago I can hear the old guitars playingOn the beach at HonaunauI can hear the old Hawaiians sayingKomo mai no kaua I ka hale welakahao It won't be long till my ship will be sailingBack to KonaA grand old placeThat's always fair to see, you're telling me I'm just a little HawaiianA homesick island boyI want to go back to my fish and poi I want to go back to my little grass shackIn Kealakekua, HawaiiWhere the humuhumunukunukuapua'aGo swimming by

One meatball, one meatball,  "Ya gets no bread with one meatball
