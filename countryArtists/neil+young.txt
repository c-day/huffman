I feel like I died and went to HeavenThe cupboards are bareBut the streets are paved with gold I saw a young girl who didn't dieI saw a glimmer from in her eyeI saw the distance, I saw the pastAnd I know I won't awaken, it's a dream that can last I feel like I died and went to HeavenThe cupboards are bareBut the streets are paved with gold And all the lights were turned down lowAnd no one wondered or had to goOut on the corner the angels sayThere is a better life for me someday I feel like I died and went to HeavenThe cupboards are bareBut the streets are paved with gold

A man needs a maid.A maid.It's hard to make that changeWhen life and love turns strange.And old.To give a love, you gotta live a love.To live a love, you gotta be "part of"When will I see you again?A while ago somewhere I don't know whenI was watching a movie with a friend.I fell in love with the actress.She was playing a part that I could understand.A maid. A man needs a maid.A maid.When will I see you again?

"There must be some kind of way out of here"Said a joker to the thief"There is too much confusion, I can't get no reliefBusinessmen, they drink my wine, ploughmen dig my earthNone of them along the line, nobody up it is worth" "No reason to get excited"The thief he kindly spoke"There are many here among usWho feel that life is but a jokeBut you and I have been through that and it is not our fateSo let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late" All along the watchtower, princess kept the viewWhile all the women came and went, barefoot servants tooOutside in the cold distance a wildcat did growlTwo riders were approaching and the wind began to howl

Back in the old folky daysThe air was magic when we played.The riverboat was rockin' in the rainMidnight was the time for the raid.Oh, Isabela, proud Isabela,They tore you down and plowed you under.You're only real with your make-up onHow could I see you and stay too long?All along the Navajo Trail,Burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails.Waitresses are cryin' in the rainWill their boyfriends pass this way again?Oh, Mother Goose, she's on the skidsSure ain't happy, neither are the kids.She needs someone that she can scream atAnd I'm such a heel for makin' her feel so bad.I guess I'll call it sickness goneIt's hard to say the meaning of this song.An ambulance can only go so fastIt's easy to get buried in the pastWhen you try to make a good thing last.I saw today in the entertainment sectionThere's room at the top for private detection.To Mom and Dad this just doesn't matter,But it's either that or pay off the kidnapper.So all you critics sit aloneYou're no better than me for what you've shown.With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreamsWe could get together for some scenes.I never knew a man could tell so many liesHe had a different story for every set of eyes.How can he remember who he's talkin' to?'Cause I know it ain't me, and I hope it isn't you.Well, I'm up in T.O. keepin' jive alive,And out on the corner it's half past five.But the subways are emptyAnd so are the cafes.Except for the Farmer's MarketAnd I still can hear him say:You're all just pissin' in the windYou don't know it but you are.And there ain't nothin' like a friendWho can tell you you're just pissin' in the wind.I never knew a man could tell so many liesHe had a different story for every set of eyesHow can he remember who he's talking to?Cause I know it ain't me, and hope it isn't you.

Across the plain flew the lone grey riderLeather bang pounding on his backAbove the clouds the moon was climbing higherA pack of wolves wanted their money backWith folded arms the chief stood watchingPainted braves slipped down the hillIn his ears the spirit talkingAs they closed inFor an easy killAt the house the door was wide openWind blew curtains off the rodShe was waiting and hopingShe was praying to her godHe was luckier than most menHe was barely in his primeAs she stood their in the doorwayHer long dress flowingWould he make it this timeOver the hill in the big green countryThat's the place where the cancer cowboy ridesPure as the driven snow before it got himSometimes I feel like he's all rightSometimes I feel like a piece of paperSometimes I feel like my own nameSometimes I feel different laterSometimes I feelI feel just the same

I'm climbin' this ladder,My head in the cloudsI hope that it matters,I'm havin' my doubts.I'm watchin' the skatersFly by on the lake.Ice frozen six feet deep,How long does it take?I look out on peaceful landsWith no war nearby,An ocean of shakin' handsThat grab at the sky.I'm singin' this borrowed tuneI took from the Rolling Stones,Alone in this empty roomToo wasted to write my own.I'm climbin' this ladder,My heads in the cloudsI hope that it matters.
Out on the trans-Canada highwayThere was a girl hitchhiking with her dogFireflies buzzin' round her headLike candles in the fog.He was three miles down the roadTryin' to stay up, but he knew that he couldn'tShe was looking for a ride through the nightBut out there, who wouldn't.They were bound for gloryBound for living on the edgeThey were bound for each otherLike two comets heading for a bed.She had a new way of livingNew way of looking at lifeHe had an '84 International and two kidsHe left back home with his wife.He was tired of writin' letters to himselfAnd living in the darkShe was open to suggestionsAnd some say she had a broken heart.He had everything he wanted'Til it all turned out to be a jobOne fallen asleep truckerAnd a girl hitchhiking with her dog.They were bound for gloryBound for living on the edgeThey were bound for each otherLike two comets heading for a bed.She had a new way of livingNew way of looking at lifeHe had an '84 International and two kidsHe left back home with his wife.Out on the trans-Canada highwayThe sun came climbing up the cabBy the time it hit the window they were wakin' upFrom what little sleep they had.When that heat hit the blanketsThey were looking for love at second sightJust starin' in each others' eyesFindin' it in the mornin' light.They were bound for gloryBound for living on the edgeThey were bound for each otherLike two blankets layin' on a bed.She had a new way of livingNew way of looking at lifeHe had an '84 International and two kidsHe left back home with his wife.
I'm like an eagleI like to fly highI'm like a snakeI like to lay lowI'm like a black manI'm like a white manMaybe a red man, I don't know I'm just a passenger on this old freight trainI ride a boxcar through the nightIt doesn't matter where I might get offIt doesn't matter where I light When the coastline is under waterAnd the desert line is under dustAnd the mountain line is closed foreverIn the great spirit I place my trust I'm just a passenger on this old freight trainI ride a boxcar through the nightIt doesn't matter where I might get offIt doesn't matter where I light
[Chorus]I'm just a passengeron this old freight trainI ride the boxcarthrough the nightI doesn't matterwhere I might get offI doesn't matter where I lie.I've been to cities,I've been to countriesI've left a lover in many townsI don't care ifI ever get back toWhere I'd already been around.I'm like an eagle,I like to fly highI'm like a snake,I like to lay lowI'm like a black man,I'm like a white manMaybe a red man, I don't know.[Chorus]

The lights turned on and the curtain fell down,And when it was over it felt like a dream,They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream,The agents had paid for the black limousineThat waited outside in the rain.Did you see them, did you see them?Did you see them in the river?They were there to wave to you.Could you tell that the empty quivered,Brown skinned Indian on the banksThat were crowded and narrow,Held a broken arrow?Eighteen years of American dream,He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall.He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall,His mother had told him a trip was a fall,And don't mention babies at all.Did you see him, did you see him?Did you see him in the river?He were there to wave to you.Could you tell that the empty quivered,Brown skinned Indian on the banksThat were crowded and narrow,Held a broken arrow?The streets were lined for the wedding parade,The Queen wore the white gloves, the county of song,The black covered caisson her horses had drawnProtected her King from the sun rays of dawn.They married for peace and were gone.Did you see them, did you see them?Did you see them in the river?They were there to wave to you.Could you tell that the empty quivered,Brown skinned Indian on the banksThat were crowded and narrow,Held a broken arrow?

I am a lonely visitor.I came to late to cause a stir,Though I campaigned all my lifeTowards that goal.I hardly slept the night you weptOur secret's safe and still well keptWhere even Richard Nixon has got soul.Even Richard Nixon has gotSoul.Traffic cops are all color blind.People steal from their own kind.Evening comes to early for a stroll.Down neon streets the streaker streaks.The speaker speaks,But the truth still leaks,Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.Even Richard Nixon has got it,Soul.The podium rocks in the crowded waves.The speaker talks of the beautiful savesThat went down long beforeHe played this roleFor the hotel queens and the magazines,Test tube genes and slot machinesWhere even Richard Nixon got soul.Even Richard Nixon has got it,Soul.Hospitals have made him cry,But there's always a free way in his eye,Though his beach just gotToo crowded for his stroll.Roads stretch out like healthy veins,And wild gift horses strain the reins,Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.Even Richard Nixon has gotSoul.I am a lonely visitor.I came to late to cause a stir,Though I campaigned all my lifeTowards that goal.

I am a young mariner headed to warI'm thinkin' 'bout my family and what it was forThere's water on the wood and the sails feel goodAnd when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good.My father was a sailor named Captain KennedyHe lost his wooden schooner to the Germans on the seaExploded on the water for everyone to seeAnd humiliate that American Captain Kennedy.I saw him in Nassau in 1971His strength was failin' but he still ran a runHe worked 'til his fingers wore to the boneTo buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own.He was known in the islands as hundred foot ironThat steel hull freighter was passin' its timeAnd time flew by faster with life on the seaAnd the days grew shorter for Captain Kennedy.I am a young mariner headed to warI'm thinkin' 'bout my family and what it was forThere's water on the wood and the sails feel goodAnd when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good.

He came dancing across the waterWith his galleons and gunsLooking for the new worldIn that palace in the sun.On the shore lay MontezumaWith his coca leaves and pearlsIn his halls he often wonderedWith the secrets of the worlds.And his subjects gathered 'round himLike the leaves around a treeIn their clothes of many colorsFor the angry gods to see.And the women all were beautifulAnd the men stood straight and strongThey offered life in sacrificeSo that others could go on.Hate was just a legendAnd war was never knownThe people worked togetherAnd they lifted many stones.They carried them to the flat landsAnd they died along the wayBut they built up with their bare handsWhat we still can't do today.And I know she's living thereAnd she loves me to this dayI still can't remember whenOr how I lost my way.He came dancing across the waterCortez, CortezWhat a killer.

Danger bird, he flies aloneAnd he rides the windBack to his homeAlthough his wingsHave turned to stoneAnd we usedTo be so calmNow I thinkAbout youAll day long    'Cause you've beenWith another man   Here you areAnd here I am.That's the momentThat he crackedLong ago in theMuseum with hisFriends.The jailbird takes the rapsAnd he finds himselfSpread-eagled on the tracksBut the training that he learnedWill get him nowhere fast.And I know weShould be freeBut freedom's justA prison to me'Cause I liedTo keep it kindWhen I left youFar behind.With the rainPounding on hisBack he recallsThe moment thatHe cracked longAgo in the museumWith his friends.And like thoseMemories the rainKeeps poundingDown, down, down.And though these wingsHave turned to stoneI can fly fly fly away.Watch me fly above the cityLike a shadow on the sky.Fly, fly, fly.
Day and night we walk these aislesIn the same old movie showAnd look for someoneTo feel for a while.There's matinees on SaturdaysWhen we sit in the velvet chairsPopcorn boxes fly through the air.Sad movies, they make you crySad movies make you wonder whyYou ever came.Do something to me,Don't make me waitStab something through me,Don't cry out the good thingsThat I appreciate.Day and night we walk these aislesIn the same old movie showAnd look for someoneTo feel for a whileThe light's go on, the movie's goneAnd the manager's up thereHe says he doesn't careAnd we take our money back.Sad movies, they make you crySad movies make you wonder whyYou ever came.
People say don't rock the boat,Let things go their own wayIdeas that once seem so right,Now have gotten hard to sayI wish I could talk to you,You could talk to me'Cause there's very few of us leftMy friendFrom the days that used to be.Seem like such a simple thingTo follow one's own dreamBut possessions and concessionAre not often what they seemThey drag you downAnd load you downIn disguise of security.But we never hadTo make those dealsIn the days that used to be.Talk to me, my long lost friend,Tell me how you areAre you happy withYour circumstance,Are you driving a new carDoes it get you where you wanna go,With a seven year warrantyOr just anotherHundred thousand miles awayFrom days that used to be.
On the lake,The deep forbidden lake,The old boats go gliding by,And the leavesAre falling from the treesAnd landing on the logs and ISee the turtlesHeading for the bogAnd falling off the log.They make the water splash,And feeling no backlash,They climb the happy banks.On the boats,The old and creaky boats,The shoreline goes gliding by,And the wind,There was a dying breeze,Is making the banners fly.See the colors,Floating in the sky,The pride of the captain's eye,As he glidesHis slender craft insideAnd opens up the door.On the coast,The long and tempting coast,The cards on the table lie,And a speech,So eloquent in reach,Was made by a passerby,Passing by the way betweenHere and left behind.And it ripples through the crowdsWho run and cast their doubtsIn the deep forbidden lake.Yes, it echoes through the crowdsWho run and cast their doubtsIn the deep forbidden lake.
Got a woman that loves meAnd I love her soBut she's all dressed up nowWith nowhere to go.All our old hang-outsAre boarded up and closedOr bein' bought by somebodyNobody knows.But things ain't that badWe still got the kidsWe're goin' out to the moviesRight after this.Goin' back to schoolSavin' up my tuitionGonna rewrite all the rulesOn the old blackboard.'Cause it seems things todayThere ain't no magic in 'emThey don't cut the gradeLike they used to.Depression bluesNowhere to goBein' bought by somebodyNobody knows.Is there anybody out thereWith a voice loud and clearGonna sing all the wordsWe all want to hear.Depression bluesNowhere to goBein' bought by somebodyNobody knows.
Well the red light shinesOn the streets of hateWhere the devil dinesWho knows what he ate"It's a simple thingTrying to stay afloat"The captain saidWithout his boatSome things are getting betterOther things a little worseIt's a situationMuch like a curse"It's the devil's sidewalkIt's the devil's doorI've tried to avoid it"Said the captain of the shoreThere's a garden growingAnd a million weedsWith no way of knowingWho's done which deed"That's an honest tale"Said the helmsman to the mate"About a woman deliciousAnd a matter of fate"Big wheel keep rollin'Down on me"One thing I can tell youIs you got to be free"John Lennon said thatAnd "I believe in love"But I believe in actionWhen push comes to shove"Who cares what you believe,"Said the captain, amazed"If you stood in my shoesYour eyes would be glazed"So, my fair damselWon't you take your leaveAre you headed for the country?Where you wear the greensleevesAnd the children laughAnd the old folks singAnd the church bell tollsFor a miraculous thingWhere the big red furnaceJust blooms and glowsWhere the big heart beatsWhere the big wheel rolls
Wish you told me by and by,That my life would come to this,That I'd have to find a way    to let things go,That my friends would turn to foes,And my love would come to blows,Then I would have done some things    differently.Differently...    I would ask you out every night.Differently...    And I would make you feel so good.Differently...    And appreciate the things that    you bring to me, babe.Differently...    Oh yes I would, oh yeah.Yeah, I know you tried and tried,But your signal I just missed,When you said my little girl    would soon be gone,Yes I didn't hear you then,And it might be too late now,That's another thing I'd do    differently.Differently...    Like trying to make you feel    loved every day.Differently...    And saying little things to    let you know how I feel.Differently...    Yes I can hear your young     voice calling me, babe.Differently...    Oh yes I can.When I 'm away I call you up,And you don't seem to miss me as much,But I know our love    is still there in your heart,Just differently.Differently...    Oh yes, I can hear your young    voice calling me, babe.Differently...    Oh yes I can.Differently...    I'd appreciate the things that you    bring to me babe, yes I would.Differently...    Oh come on back to me babe,    bring your love back to me.Differently...    Oh yeah I need your love,    I need your love.Differently...

The flash from a distant cameraReconnecting thoughts and actionsFragments of our missing dreamPieces from here and thereFall in place along the lineDisappearing between you and meLife is changing everywhere I goNew things and old both disappearIf life is a photograph fading in the mirrorAll I want is a song of loveSong of love to sing for youAll I need is this song of loveTo sing for you.On the floor where daylight dancesWith the ones that missed their chancesWhen they couldn't let it showLies the land of sweet surrenderLike a dream it might have ended thereBut we didn't even knowNow forever we will live as one,Floating in love's atmosphereIf love is a piece of dust shining in the sun,All I want is a song of loveSong of love to sing to youAll I need is this song for loveTo sing for youSong of loveSong of love

Old man lying by the side of the roadWith the lorries rolling by,Blue moon sinking from the weight of the loadAnd the building scrape the sky,Cold wind ripping down the allay at dawnAnd the morning paper flies,Dead man lying by the side of the roadWith the daylight in his eyes.Don't let it bring you downIt's only castles burning,Find someone who's turningAnd you will come around.Blind man running through the light of the nightWith an answer in his hand,Come on down to the river of sightAnd you can really understand,Red lights flashing through the window in the rain,Can you hear the sirens moan?White cane lying in a gutter in the lane,If you're walking home alone.Don't let it bring you downIt's only castles burning,Just find someone who's turningAnd you will come around.Don't let it bring you downIt's only castles burning,Just find someone who's turningAnd you will come around.

In the crystal ballThe gypsy sees the villaThe riders on the hillThe fire in the fieldsShe sees the mission bellSwinging in the silenceNow the shooting startsThe bullets pierce the heartsThe senoritas crying at the well.Up in the Gold HotelThe money hits the tableThe heavies all are thereThat's why the deal's goin' downBeautiful women all dressed inDiamonds and sableDown upon the streetBeside a garbage heapA Mariachi band begins to play.Somewhere a blues guitarPlays echoes in the alleywayThe Tijuana dawnClaims another dayThe golden sunRises on the runwayThe pilot understandsThe money changes handsInside the jet the briefcase snaps. Goodbye.In Eldorado townThere lives a great bullfighterHis eyes are screaming blueHis hair is red as bloodAnd when the gate goes upThe crowd gets so excitedAnd he comes dancin' outDressed in gold lameHe kills the bull and lives another day.

Four strong winds that blow lonely, Seven seas that run high,All these things that don't change, Come what may.But our good times are all gone,And I'm bound for moving on.I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.Think I'll go out to Alberta,Weather's good there in the fall.Got some friends that I can go to working for,Still I wish you'd change your mindIf I asked you one more time,But we've been through that a hundred times or more.If I get there before the snow flies,And if things are going good,You could meet me if I send you down the fare.But by then it will be winter, there ain't too much for you to do,And those wind sure can blow way out there.

In a foreign landThere were creatures at playRunning hand in handLeading nowhere to stayDriven to the mountains highThey were sunken in the cities deepLivin' in my sleep.I feel like goin' backBack where there's nowhere to stayWhen fire fills the skyI'll still remember that dayThese rocks I'm climbin' downHave already left the groundCareening through space.I used to build these buildingsI used to walk next to youTheir shadows tore us apartAnd now we do what we doDriven to the mountains highSunken in the cities deepLivin' in our sleep.I feel like goin' backBack where there's nowhere to stay.
On the hill where Custer was,Making his last stand,With the Indians all around,And his gun in his hand.Such a wind was blowing that day,Through the battleground,I could feel it in my hair,As I turned towards downtown.Weaving through the buildings,Cutting though the streets,Slicing through the culture,Piling on the weeks.Going home, I'm going home.Going home, I'm going home.Going home.Dropping in on you my friend,Is just like old times,Said the fool who signed the paper,To assorted slimes.It's hard to get blood from a stoneBut for you I'll give it a try,To provide your accomodations,And leave you satisfied.You'd think it was easy,To give your life away,To not have to live up to,The promises you made.Going home, I'm going home.Going home, I'm going home.Going home.Elusively she cut the phone,Moved from cell to cell,Really looking remarkable,And obviously doing well.She made a turn on a wooden bridge,Into the battleground,With a thousand warriors on the ridge,She tried to turn her radio down.Battle drums were pounding,All around her car,She saw her clothes were changing,Into sky and stars.Going home, I'm going home.Going home, I'm going home.Going home, I'm going home.Going home, I'm going home.Going home.

"Grandpa, here's your coffee,"Said Edith, as she filled his cup."Nobody'll find you here,And Earl is glad you guys showed up.""The way things are downtown,You might have to stay for awhile.There was a helicopter hovering over your houseWhen I talked to your neighbor, Kyle.""Who the hell do they think they are,Invading our home like that?Grandma and I had to leave so fast,We couldn't even catch the cat.""The helicopter scared the shit out of him,And it took off down a trail,Down past the railroad track,Towards the county jail.""Jed, you really screwed up now!What did you have to do that for?Everybody wants to hang your ass,And here's a note from Lenore."Sun touched the cold steel barsAs she pushed the paper in.Jed took it up and read itAnd he couldn't hide a grin.Outside the jail windowA crow flew across the sky,Completely disappearing behind each bar,Then a helicopter flew by."Say hi to Earl and Edith.Tell 'm I'm doing fine.Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now,They should cut the line.""Can grandma come and see me?I got a new song to singIt's longer than all the others combinedAnd it doesn't mean a thing."The noise was unfamiliar,Generators whirling,Walkie-talkies screaming,Vans parked in the open field.TV crews and cameras,They wanted to interview grandpa on the porch.They came through the gate and across the lawnKnocking down Edith's Tiki Torch.And grandpa saw them there,Looking through the venetian blind."Those people don't have any respect,So they won't get any of mine.""I don't wanna talk about Jed.I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9.I don't have time to talk that fast,And it ain't my crime.""It ain't a privilege to be on TVAnd it ain't a duty either.The only good thing about TVIs shows like 'Leave it to Beaver.'""'Shows with love and affection',Like mama used to say.A little Mayberry livingCould go a long way."He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet,Loaded up both barrels.Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off,And up walked a woman named Carol."Susan Carol from Early Magazine,I got some questions to ask.""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine!"Grandpa said with a gasp.Then he fell face first and let out a sigh,And Edith ran out in shock.He was looking at her from down on the floor,Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk."That guy just keeps singin'!Can somebody shut him up?I don't know for the life of meWhere he comes up with that stuff."They laid his head on a newspaperWith a picture of Carmichael on the front page,Posing with the little league baseball team,And a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle.Grandpa died a hero.Trying to stop the media.Fighting for freedom of silence.Trying to be anonymous.Share your loving and you live so long.Share your loving and you live so long.Share your loving and you live so long.Live so long.

The night was coldAnd the wind was howlingI was awaken by the soundOf hoof beats pounding.Outside the window,On the groundOur hound dog was growlingGrey Riders flew across my lawnI looked againAnd they all were gone.That voice was callingAnd it cut through the nightCome on boys, let her go.Up on a hillThey rode in one long columnThey were freezing with the chillsOf the new day dawning.Their hair long and greyThey heard just one voice callingGrey Riders on the morning sky,The sun made diamondsOf their road-weary eyes.That voice is callingAnd it cut through the nightCome on boys, let her go.The night was coldAnd the wind was howlingI was awaken by the soundOf hoof beats pounding.Outside the window, on the groundOur hound dog was growlingGrey Riders flew across my lawnI looked againAnd they all were gone.That voice was callingAnd it cut through the nightCome on boys, let her go.

Oh, hello Mr. Soul,I dropped byTo pick up a reasonFor the thought that I caughtThat my headIs the event of the seasonWhy in crowds just a traceOf my faceCould seem so pleasin'I'll cop out to the change,But a strangerIs putting the tease on.I was down on a frownWhen the messengerBrought me a letterI was raised by the praiseOf a fanWho said I upset herAny girl in the worldCould have easilyKnown me betterShe said, You're strange,But don't change,And I let her.In a while will the smileOn my faceTurn to plaster?Stick around while the clownWho is sickDoes the trick of disasterFor the race of my headAnd my faceIs moving much fasterIs it strange I should change?I don't know,Why don't you ask her?

Now that the holidays have comeThey can relax and watch the sunRise above all of the beautiful thingsThey've done.Go to the country take the dogLook at the sky without the smogSee the world laugh at the farmers feeding hogsEat hot dogs.What a pityThat the people from the cityCan't relate to the slower thingsThat the country brings.Time itself is bought and sold.The spreading fear of growing oldContains a thousand foolish gamesThat we play.While people planning trips to starsAllow another boulevard to claimA quiet country laneIt's insane.So the subtle face is a loserThis time around.Here we are in the yearsWhere the showman shifts the gearsLives become careersChildren cry in fearLet us out of here!

The brick jail doors that closed behind are crackingThe school boy told the woman in the streetLast night I heard the bells of summer rappingThe word vows of a mother incompleteThe emptiness of summer must begin itThe nagging of the mother of the wildConvinced me that I had no way to win itShe took it from my hand and then she smiledThe coldness of the closeness of the moonbeamThe walking in the dawn to greet the nightThe water and the flower is a bad dreamThe stocking drawn reveals the end of sightIt's over 'cause it's older than the midnightThe school boy told the woman on the streetThe joining of the weekend, Monday daylightWill leave the black rose meeting incomplete
Morning has come,With the first rays of sun,Breakin' through our window pane.Songs fill the air,But there's no singer there,Just an old wooden guitar playin'.Writing a song,Won't take very long,Trying not to use the word "old".Thinking about,Taking chances and doubts,That still linger in the cold.Looking forward,All that I can see,Is good things happeningTo you and to me.I'm not waiting,For times to change.I'm going to live,Like a free-roamin' soul,On the highway of our love.Looking forward,All that I can see,Is good things happeningTo you and to me.I'm not waiting,For times to change.I want to live,Like a free-roamin' soul,On the highway of our love.Morning has come,With the first rays of sun,Breaking through our window pane.Songs fill the air,But there's no singer there,Just an old wooden guitar playin'.

Take my adviceDon't listen to meIt ain't paradiseBut it used to beThere was a timeWhen the river was wideAnd the water came running downTo the rising tideBut the wooden shipsWere just a hippie dreamJust a hippie dream.Don't bat an eyeDon't waste a wordDon't mention nothin'That could go unheard'Cause the tie-dye sailsAre the screamin' sheetsAnd the dusty trailLeads to blood in the streetsAnd the wooden shipsAre a hippie dreamCapsized in excessIf you know what I mean.Just because it's over for youDon't mean it's over for meIt's a victory for the heartEvery time the music startsSo please don't kill the machineDon't kill the machineDon't kill the machine.Another flower child goes to seedIn an ether-filled room of meat-hooksIt's so uglySo ugly.

Once there was an Inca QueenShe gazed at her sundialAll around her workers raisedGolden idols to her smileThe waiting years weren't hard to seeBehind the tears of Mercury.She spoke of silver from the skyAnd many floating safety boatsTo pick them up when they would flyFar above their dreams and hopesAnd they a mountain city raisedWhere their queen above the cloudsCould watch out.Inca Queen has,Inca Queen has,Inca Queen has comeInca Queen has,Inca Queen has,Inca Queen has come.Out in the jungleThe drums were heard:Inca Queen has comeFrom the biggest elephantTo the smallest bird:Inca Queen has comeShe spoke of silver from the sky,Inca Queen has comeTo pick them up when they would fly,Inca Queen has come.Once there was an Inca QueenShe gazed at her sundialAll around her workers raisedGolden idols to her smileAnd though the air was thin and coldSoon the day would comeThe queen had told.Inca Queen has,Inca Queen has,Inca Queen has come.
Children are laughingIn the sunI count the voicesOne by oneBut I'm not thereTo share the funI'm out on the interstateI can hearA soft voice callingCalling meTo bring my guitar home.I'm happy singingIn a crowdThe lights are bright,The music's loudI like to lookIn every faceBut out on the interstateI can hearA soft voice callingCalling meTo bring my guitar home.Out in the dustyDesert windThe fox goes lookingFor a friendShe sees a lightAround the bendI'm out on the interstateI can hearA soft voice callingCalling meTo bring my guitar home.

When you're lost in the rain in JuarezAnd it's Easter time, tooAnd your gravity failsAnd negativity don't pull you through Don't put on any airsWhen you're down on Rue Morgue AvenueThey got some hungry women thereAnd they really make a mess out of you Now, if you see Saint AnniePlease tell her, "Thanks a lot"I cannot moveMy fingers are all in a knot I don't have the strength to get upAnd take another shotAnd my best friend, my doctorWon't even say what it is I've got Sweet Melinda, the peasants callHer the Goddess of gloomShe speaks good EnglishAnd she invites you up into her room And you're so kindAnd careful not to go to her too soonAnd she takes your voiceAnd leaves you howling at the moon Up on Housing Project HillIt's either fortune or fameYou must pick one or the otherThough neither of them are to be what they claim If you're lookin' to get sillyYou better go back to from where you cameBecause the cops don't need youAnd man, they expect the same Now, all the authoritiesThey just stand around and boastHow they blackmailed the sergeant at armsInto leaving his post And picking up angelWho just arrived here from the coastWho looked so fine at firstBut left looking just like a ghost I started out on BurgundyBut soon hit the harder stuffEverybody said they'd stand behind meWhen the game got rough But the joke was on meThere was nobody even there to bluffI'm going back to New York CityI do believe I've had enough

Well, I used to drive a cab, you knowI heard a siren screamPulled over to the cornerAnd I fell into a dreamThere were two men eating penniesAnd three young girls who criedThe West coast is falling,I see rocks in the sky.The preacher took his bibleAnd laid it on the stool.He said: with the congregation running,Why should I play the fool?Well, I used to be a woman, you knowI took you for a ride,I let you fly my airplaneIt looked good for your pride.'Cause you're the kind of man you knowWho likes what he says.I wonder what's it's likeTo be so far over my head.Well, the lady made the weddingAnd she brought along the ring.She got down on her kneesAnd said: Let's get on with this thing.Well, I used to be a folk singerKeeping managers alive,When you saw me on a cornerAnd told me I was jive.So I unlocked your mind, you knowTo see what I could see.If you guarantee the postage,I'll mail you back the key.Well I woke up in the morningWith an arrow through my noseThere was an Indian in the cornerTrying on my clothes.Well, I used to be asleep you knowWith blankets on my bed.I stayed there for a while'Till they discovered I was dead.The coroner was friendlyAnd I liked him quite a lot.If I hadn't of been a womanI guess I'd never have been caught.They gave me back my house and carAnd nothing more was said.Well, I was driving down the freewayWhen my car ran out of gas.Pulled over to the stationBut I was afraid to ask.The servicemen were yellowAnd the gasoline was green.Although I knew I couldn'tI thought that I was gonna scream.That was on my last trip to TulsaJust before the snow.If you ever need a ride there,Be sure to let me know.I was chopping down a palm treeWhen a friend dropped by to askIf I would feel less lonelyIf he helped me swing the axe.I said: "No, it's not a case of being lonelyWe have here,I've been working on this palm treeFor eighty seven years."I said: No, it's not a case of being lonelyWe have here,I've been working on this palm treeFor eighty seven years."He said: "Go get lost!"And walked towards his Cadillac.I chopped down the palm treeAnd it landed on his back.
Out on the old coast highwayFlying through the nightJed got stopped by the CHPFor speedin' and no brake lightsRolled down the driver's windowSlipped his gun down under his seatThe glove-box was full of cocaineThe trunk was full of weed"Driver's license and registration,"Said the officer with his flashlightSearch around the floor, look hardSmellin' like something ain't rightJed's life flashed before himLike a scratchy old super-8He heard the sound of the futureOn an RPM 78Nothing was still, all was movingWhen the flashlight found the gunThen Jed pulled the triggerIn a split-second tragic blunder"It makes you think about livingWhat life has to tell,"Said Jed to GrandpaFrom inside his cellCamouflage hung in his closetGuns all over the wallPlans for buildings and engineersAnd a book with no numbers at allThe whole town was stunnedThey closed the coast highway for twelve hoursNo one could get inJed was one of oursMeanwhile across the oceanLiving in the internetIs the cause of an explosionNo one has heard yetBut there's no need to worryThere's no reason to fussJust go on about your work nowAnd leave the drivin' to usAnd we'll be watching youNo matter what you doAnd you can do your partBy watchin' others tooGrandpa put down the paperStaring in disbeliefJed had always been good to himNever gave him any griefThe moral of this storyIs try not to get too oldThe more time you spend on earthThe more you see unfoldAnd as an afterthoughtThis must, too, be toldSome people have taken pure bullshitAnd turned it into gold

Back in the days of covered wagonsA man had his own wayWhether talkin' to a womanOr crossing the U.S.A.No telephones were ringingNo angry words exchanged.I wish I was back in the saddle nowRiding on the range.Let your fingers do the walkingCall me up some timeI'm listed under Broken HeartsLooking for a good time.I can't reach out and touch youYou're hung up on the lineI'm your disconnected number nowAnd you're a private line.Well, I used to be so happy,When you gave good 'phone.I could call you up from anywhereFor a little bit of homeBut now my heart is achingAfter every callBy the way you talk you'd thinkYou never gave good 'phone at all.Let your fingers do the walkingCall me up some timeI'm listed under Broken HeartsLooking for a good time.I can't reach out and touch youYou're hung up on the lineI'm your disconnected number nowAnd you're a private line.Let your fingers do the walkingCall me up some timeI'm listed under Broken Hearts.Looking for a good time.I can't reach out and touch youYou're hung up on the lineI'm your disconnected number nowAnd you're a private line.
I think this song is an instrumental.  And it's also a Beachboy cut from the Petsounds album.  I remember that for two reasons--listening to the album and not being sure why a Beachboy song would appear here, and reading a Rolling Stone review.I remember this Rolling Stone Magazine article complaining about the fact that Brian Wilson used the song at the end of the album.  I'm pretty sure that

Instead of cursing in the darkness,Light a candle for where were going,There's something ahead, worth fighting for,When the light of time is on us, you will see our moment come,And the living sole inside will carry on,It's a chance to give new meaning to every move we make,In the cavern, in the cave, where we've come fromWhen the light of dawn is on us,We will see what we can be,And the ancient ones will sleep the music sleep?In the hallways of the ages, on the road to history,What we do now will always be with us.It's a chance to give new meaning to every move we make,In the caverns in the caves where we've gone wrongInstead of cursing in the darkness,Light a candle for where were going,There's something ahead, worth looking for,When the light of time is on us,We will see our moment come,And the living sole inside will carry on,Light a candle in the darkness,So that others might see it,Light a candle in the darkness, when you go,Light a candle in the darkness so others might see ahead,Light a candle in the darkness when you go.

Once I thought I saw you in a crowded hazy bar,Dancing on the light from star to star.Far across the moonbeam I know that's who you are,I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire.You are like a hurricaneThere's calm in your eye.And I'm gettin' blown awayTo somewhere safer where the feeling stays.I want to love you but I'm getting blown away.I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream,You could have been anyone to me.Before that moment you touched my lipsThat perfect feeling when time just slipsAway between us on our foggy trip.You are like a hurricaneThere's calm in your eye.And I'm gettin' blown awayTo somewhere safer where the feeling stays.I want to love you but I'm getting blown away.You are just a dreamer, and I am just a dream.You could have been anyone to me.Before that moment you touched my lipsThat perfect feeling when time just slipsAway between us on our foggy trip.You are like a hurricaneThere's calm in your eye.And I'm gettin' blown awayTo somewhere safer where the feeling stays.I want to love you but I'm getting blown away.
Said the condor to the preying mantisWe're gonna lose this place just like we lost AtlantisBrother we got to go sooner than you knowThe Gypsy told my fortune, she said that nothin' showed.Who put the bomb on the sacred altar?Why should we die if it comes our way?Why should we care about a little buttonBeing pushed by someone we don't even know?Well. I wish I was an Aztec,Or a runner in PeruI would build such beautiful buildingsTo house the chosen fewLike an Inca from Peru.If you want to get high, build a strong foundationSink those pylons deep now and reach for the skyIf you want to get lost in the jungle rhythmGet down on the ground and pretend you're swimmin'.If you want to put ice in the lava riverFirst you must climb, then you must stand and shiverBrother we got to go sooner than you knowThe Gypsy told my fortune, the Gypsy told my fortune,The Gypsy told my fortune, she said that nothing showedWell I wish I was an Aztec,Or a runner in PeruI would build such beautiful buildingsTo house the chosen fewLike an Inca from Peru.Said the condor to the preying mantisWe're gonna lose this place just like we lost AtlantisBrother we got to go sooner than you knowThe Gypsy told my fortune, the Gypsy told my fortune,The Gypsy told my fortune, she said that nothin' showed.Who put the bomb on the sacred altar?Why should we die if it comes our way?Why should we care about a little buttonBeing pushed by someone we don't even know?Well. I wish I was an Aztec,Or a runner in PeruI would build such beautiful buildingsTo house the chosen fewLike an Inca from Peru.I feel sad, but I feel happyAs I'm coming back to homeThere's a bridge across the riverThat I have to cross aloneLike a skipping rolling stoneLike an Inca.
See somebody walkin' down the streetHangin' head and a-shufflin' feetDon't take much to seeWhat they've been thinkin' of.What makes you hypnotized?What puts a tear in your eye?What makes you have to choose?What brings you the blues?A little thing called loveA little thing called love.Only love puts a tear in your eyeOnly love makes you hypnotizedOnly love makes you chooseOnly love brings you the blues.Wait a minute now, honeyDon't be sadThis may be the best love you ever hadThat don't mean that you had enoughA little thing called loveA little thing called love.Only love puts a tear in your eyeOnly love makes you hypnotizedOnly love makes you chooseOnly love brings you the blues.A little thing called loveA little thing called love.

He's a perfect stranger,Like a cross of himself and a fox.He's a feeling arrangerAnd a changer of the ways he talks.He's the unforeseen dangerThe keeper of the key to the locks.Know when you see him,Nothing can free him.Step aside, open wide,It's the loner.If you see him in the subway,He'll be down at the end of the car.Watching you moveUntil he knows he knows who you are.When you get off at your station alone,He'll know that you are.Know when you see him,Nothing can free him.Step aside, open wide,It's the loner.There was a woman he knewAbout a year or so ago.She had something that he neededAnd he pleaded with her not to go.On the day that she left,He died, but it did not show.Know when you see him,Nothing can free him.Step aside, open wide,It's the loner.
We've been throughSome things togetherWith trunks of memoriesStill to comeWe found things to doIn stormy weatherLong may you run.Long may you run.Long may you run.Although these changesHave comeWith your chrome heart shiningIn the sunLong may you run.Well, it wasBack in Blind River in 1962When I last saw you aliveBut we missed that shiftOn the long declineLong may you run.Long may you run.Long may you run.Although these changesHave comeWith your chrome heart shiningIn the sunLong may you run.Maybe The Beach BoysHave got you nowWith those wavesSinging "Caroline No"Rollin' downThat empty ocean roadGettin' to the surf on time.Long may you run.Long may you run.Although these changesHave comeWith your chrome heart shiningIn the sunLong may you run.

Morning has come,With the first rays of sun,Breakin' through our window pane.Songs fill the air,But there's no singer there,Just an old wooden guitar playin'.Writing a song,Won't take very long,Trying not to use the word "old".Thinking about,Taking chances and doubts,That still linger in the cold.Looking forward,All that I can see,Is good things happeningTo you and to me.I'm not waiting,For times to change.I'm going to live,Like a free-roamin' soul,On the highway of our love.Looking forward,All that I can see,Is good things happeningTo you and to me.I'm not waiting,For times to change.I want to live,Like a free-roamin' soul,On the highway of our love.Morning has come,With the first rays of sun,Breaking through our window pane.Songs fill the air,But there's no singer there,Just an old wooden guitar playin'.
A hip drag queen and a side-walkin' street wheeler,Comin' down the avenue.They're all your friends, you'll come to love 'emThere's a load of 'em waitin' for you.Lookout Joe, you're comin' home.Old times were good times,Old times were good times.Remember Millie from down in Philly?She took my brain and forgot my name.The woman you were with was about the sameShe took your money and left town.Lookout Joe, you're comin' home.Old times were good times,Old times were good times.Glory Hallelujah!Will I lay my burden down?Singin' on the streets around:Look at that crazy clown.Remember Bill from up on the hill?A Cadillac put a hole in his arm.But old Bill, he's up there still,Havin' a ball rollin' to the bottom.Lookout Joe, you're comin' home.Old times were good times,Old times were good times.
I built a house of cardsBuilt a house of rainBuilt a house of loveIt's hard to build againBuilt a road to reasonBuilt a road to fateBuilt a roadTo the promised landRight up to the gateLoose change in my pocketFuture in my handToo many distractionsFor me to understandToo many distractionsGot to get back homeGet into something solidGet out of the zoneSome roads bring renewalSome roads hide and waitSome roadsPromise everythingAnd steal your fuel awayLoose change in my pocketFuture in my handToo many distractionsFor me to understandSome roads I been flyin'Some roads I crashedSome roadsI been sleepin' onSome roads I got backSome roads I been runnin'Some roads I was stoppedSome roadsI been walkin downSome roads I was lost
I went into town to see youYesterdayBut you were not home.So I talked to some old friendsFor a whileBefore I wandered off alone.It's so hard for me nowBut I'll make it somehow,Though I know I'll never be the same.Won't you ever change your ways,It's so hard to make love payWhen you're on the losing end,And I feel that way again.Well, I miss you more than ever,Since you've goneI can hardly maintain.Things are different round hereEvery night,My tears fall down like rain.It's so hard for me nowBut I'll make it somehow,Though I know I'll never be the same.Won't you ever change your ways,It's so hard to make love payWhen you're on the losing end,And I feel that way again.
Live with me, live with meLive with me, live with meLive with me.Lost in spaceI heard you were lost in spaceThat's such a lonely place for you to be.Out of controlSingin' with too much soulI heard you got out on paroleWorkin' for the queen.Gardening againLandscape againKeepin' all the grounds around her cleanWorkin' for the queen.Don't take out the magic penDon't draw on the infinity boardYour buildings, if they rise againWould do much better on the ocean floorThey'll never feel the way they did beforeThey did before.Out on the ocean floor, out on the ocean floorWhat could be stranger than the unknown dangerThat lies on the ocean floor?Breakers crash on the beachI count them like lambs in my sleepThey come at me steadyThey know I'm not readyThey pound on my mattress doorHave they got a big one in store.Losing youI heard I was losing youThat's not the only thing that I got to loseI got to loseThe deep see bluesLook at these bluesThe deep see bluesLive with me, live with me.

Woke up this morning with love in mindIt was raining outside but my love still shinedKept me warm till my plane touched the skyAnd I've seen love make a fool of a manHe tried to make a loser win.But I've got nothing to lose I can't get back again.Man made rules been holdin' back my loveCan't hold it back no more.Churches long preach sex is wrongJesus where is nature gone?What am I doing here?What am I doing here?What am I doing here?Woke up this morning with love in mindIt was raining outside but my love still shinedKept me warm till my plane touched the sky
Love is a rose but you better not pick itIt only grows when it's on the vine.A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed itYou lose your love when you say the word mine.I want to see what's never been seen,I want to live that age old dream.Come on, lads, we can go togetherLet's take the best right now,Take the best right now.I want to go to an old hoe-downLong ago in a western town.Pick me up cause my feet are draggin'Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon.Love is a rose but you better not pick itIt only grows when it's on the vine.A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed itYou lose your love when you say the word mine.Mine, mine.Love is a rose, love is a rose.Love is a rose, love is a rose.

Oh, hello Mr. Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reasonFor the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the seasonWhy in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on.I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letterI was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset herAny girl in the world could have easily known me betterShe said, You're strange, but don't change, and I let her.In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disasterFor the race of my head and my face is moving much fasterIs it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?

On the roller coaster rideThat my emotions have to take me onI heard a newborn baby cryThrough the night.I heard a perfect echo dieInto an anonymous wall of digital soundSomewhere deep insideOf my soul.A natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to natureDon't judge yourself too harsh, my loveOr someday you might find your soul endangeredA natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to nature.AmazonYou had so much and now so much is goneWhat are you gonna doWith your life?What a lucky man.To see the earth before it touched his handWhat an angry foolTo condemn.One more night to goOne more sleep upon your burning banksA greedy man never knowsWhat he's done.A natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to natureDon't start yourself too short, my loveOr someday you might find your soul endangeredA natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to nature.Went to the rodeo todayI saw the cowgirls lined up on the fenceA brand new ChevroletA brand new pair of seamless pants.We watched the moment of defeatPlayed back over on the video screenSomewhere deep insideOf my soul.A natural beauty should be preserved like a monument to nature.

Once I was in loveNow, it seems that timeIs better spentSearching than in findingBut no one seems to know.So don't say you lose,Don't say you lose,Don't say you win,And no one else will know,No one else will know.When you're downYou gather strengthTo leave the groundAnd when you're highIt makes you weakAnd you fall back down.Once I was in loveNow, it seems that timeIs better spentSearching than in findingBut no one seems to know.
See the bluebird fly easy as a dream,Dipping and bobbing in the sun.Could she be the one I saw so long ago?Could she be the one to take me home?This pasture is green.I'm walking in the sun.It's turning brown.I'm standing in the rain.My overcoat is worn,The pockets are all torn.I'm moving away from the pain.Tick.Tock.The clock on the wall.No wonder we're losing time.Ring.Ring.The old church bell.The bride and her loveSeeking guidance from above.Amber waves of grain bow in the prairie wind.I'm hearing Willie singing on the radio again.That song from nine eleven keeps ringing in my head.I'll always remember something Chris Rock said.Don't send no more candles,No matter what you do.Then Willie stopped singingAnd the prairie wind blew.The green kept rolling onFor miles and miles.Fields of fuel rolling on for miles.Tick.Tock.The clock on the wall.No wonder we're losing time.Toll.Toll.The fallen soldier bell.The old church on the hillStill standing when so many fell.Back when I was young,The birds blocked out the sun,Before the great migration south.We only shot a few.They last the winter through.Mother cooked them good and served them up.Somewhere a Senator sits in a leather chairBehind a big wooden desk.The caribou we killed means nothing to him.He took his money just like all the rest.Tick.Tock.The clock on the wall.No wonder we're losing time.Ring.Ring.Ring the wedding bells.The bride takes the ringAnd the happy people sing.
There's plenty of foodOn the tableLots of love in the houseThe children all do whatThey're able to doWe got so much to be happy about.I got a woman standing beside meShe really knowsHow to stand by her manShe's strong and she's softAnd she's honest to meShe really helps meTo be a good man.But nothing is perfectIn God's perfect planLook in the shadow to seeHe only gave us the good thingsSo we'd understandWhat life without them would be.There's plenty of wheatOn the prairiesLots of coal in the minesWe got soldiers so strongThey can bury their deadAnd still not go backShooting blind.There's women and menOn the workforceDoing forty hoursPlus overtimeSo the hostagesHeld at the airportCan come homeTo something worthwhile.But nothing is perfectIn God's perfect planLook in the shadow to seeHe only gave us the good thingsSo we'd understandWhat life without them would be.And there's plenty of foodOn the tableLots of love in the houseThe children all doWhat they're able to doWe got so much to be happy about.I got a woman standing beside meShe really knowsHow to stand by her manShe's strong and she's softAnd she's honest to meIt  really helps meTo be a good man.But nothing is perfectIn God's perfect planHe only gave us the good thingsSo we'd understand.No, nothing is perfectIn God's perfect plan.
Who's that stomping all over my face?Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace?Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rungAnd taking my gypsy before she's begunTo singing the meaning of what's in my mindBefore I can take home what's rightfully mine.Joinin' and listenin' and talkin' in rhymesStoppin' the feeling to wait for the times.Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.And who's all hung-up on that happiness thing?Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings?And who's in the corner and down on the floorWith pencil and paper just counting the score?And who's trying to act like he's just in between?The line isn't black, if you know that it's green.Don't bother looking, you're too blind to seeWho's coming on like he wanted to be.Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five?Who's got the feeling that he came alive,Though havin' it, sharin' it ain't quite the sameIt ain't no gold nugget, you can't lay a claimWho's seeing eyes through the crack in the floorThere it is baby, don't you worry no moreWho should be sleepin', but is writing this songWishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damned wrong.Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing,'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing.
In the jungle landWith the sea and the sandCan I meet you there?We'll be drinkin' bananasFrom long tall glassesIn the open air.Ocean girlCome 'round the worldFrom forgotten shores.There'll be music playin'What no words could sayWhen you first get there.We'll be lost in a cornerThat we find in each otherThere' so much to share.Ocean girlCome 'round the worldFrom forgotten shores.
When the day is doneAnd the sun is sinking lowWhen you see the lightWhen you been most everywhereYou goYou goWhen the traffic's slowBreak lines lined up for miles and milesAnd you know the end is not in sightYou can never take your ridesOff the roadOff the roadWhen you're all aloneAnd you've been driving through the nightAnd you know the end is not in sightYou can never take your ridesOff the roadOff the road
Everybody's going out and having funI'm a fool for staying home and having none.I can't get over how she set me free.Oh, lonesome me.There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome bluesForget about my past and find someone newI've thought of everything from A to ZOh, lonesome me.I'll bet she's not like me.She's out and fancy free,Flirting with the boys with all her charmsBut I still love her so,And brother don't you knowI'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,We're finally on our own.This summer I hear the drumming,Four dead in OhioGotta get down to itSoldiers are cutting us downShould have been done long ago.What if you knew herAnd found her dead on the groundHow can you run when you know?Gotta get down to itSoldiers are cutting us downShould have been done long ago.What if you knew herAnd found her dead on the groundHow can you run when you know?Tin soldiers and Nixon comingWe're finally on our own.This summer I hear the drumming,Four dead in Ohio.
They were playing that old country waltzIn this empty bar echoin' off the wall.When I first got the bad news that you set me free,The band played the old country waltz to me.Well, I loved, and I lost, and I criedThe day that the two of us died.Ain't got no excuses, I just want to rideWhile the band plays the old country waltz.Out the window the moon shinesOn the roofs of the carsWhile I knock down tequila and saltAnd the band plays the old country waltz.And we're playin' it, that old country waltzIn this empty bar echoin' off the wall.Ain't got no excuses, we just want to playThat good old country waltz.I ain't got no excuses, I just want to playThat good old country waltz.That good old country waltz.
There was an I'll wind blowingThrough my hair last nightThat froze me in my blue jeans.I couldn't find a lightI know that something's comingI can feel it in my bonesThank GodFor those old country boys,I ain't out here alone.My friends all tell meI got daggers in my eyesThere's an anger in my heartThat they don't realizeI'm mad as hell at somethingThat I don't understandThank GodI'm on the road tonightWith this old hillbilly band.Thank GodI'm on the road tonightWith this old hillbilly band.We may not be good lookingBut we sure get outta handWas that The Devil's stagecoachFlying over the Rio Grande?Thank GodI'm on the road tonightWith this old hillbilly band.I swear that The DevilCame visiting me last nightSurrounded my old stagecoachWith his eerie lightHe was pounding on my windowsRattling my wheelsI may not be The DevilBut I know just how he feels.Thank GodI'm on the road tonightWith this old hillbilly band.We may not be good lookingBut we sure get outta handWas that The Devil's stagecoachFlying over the Rio Grande?Thank GodI'm on the road tonightWith this old hillbilly band.
Up and down the old homesteadThe naked rider gallops through his headAnd although the moon isn't fullHe still feels the pull.Out on the floor where the cowboys danceApproaching slowly at a glanceHere comes the shadow of his stanceThe reins are fallin' from his hands.Why do you ride that crazy horse?Inquires the shadow with little remorseJust then a priest comes down the stairsWith a sack of dreams and old nightmares.Who are you, the rider saysYou dress in black but you talk like a FedYou spout ideas from books that you readDon't you care about this guy's head?Just then the sound of hoof beats was heardAnd the sky was darkened by a prehistoric birdWho flew between the unfulfilled moonAnd the naked rider, to a telephone booth.We'll call the moon and see what's upI've got some change in this little tin cupWe'll say that the shadow is growin' dimAnd we need some light to get back to himJust one call should do it allI'll carve this number on the wallWith my beak.Flying feathers were all aroundThe air was filled with a ringing sound.Two more birds, the second and the thirdCame down from the sky to deliver the word.Where have you been, they said to the firstGet back to the clouds, we're dying of thirstThere's not enough time to make that callLet's ditch this rider, shadow and all.The sky was filled with the beautiful birdsStill on the ground some crying was heardWith his dime in his hand and his hand on the dialHis ears were sweating as he forced a smile.Hoof beats beating across the rangeHe rode through the night with his cup of changeTired and beaten he fell into slumberBut up in the sky they still had his number.Up and down the old homesteadThe naked rider gallops through his headAnd although the moon isn't fullHe still feels the pull,Still feels the pull.
King went a-runnin' after deerWasn't scared of jumpin' off the truck in high gearKing went a-sniffin' and he would goWas the best old hound dog I ever did know.I had a dog and his name was KingI told the dog about everythingThere in my truck the dog and IThen one day the King up and died.Then I thought about the times we hadOnce when I kicked him when he was badOld King sure meant a lot to meBut that hound dog is history.King went a-runnin' after deerWasn't scared of jumpin' off the truck in high gearKing went a-sniffin' and he would goWas the best old hound dog I ever did know.That old King was a friend of mineNever knew a dog  that was half as fineI may find one, you never do know'Cause I still got a long way to go.I had a dog and his name was KingI told the dog about everythingOld King sure meant a lot to meBut that hound dog is history.King went a-howlin' after deerWasn't scared of jumpin' off the truck in high gearKing went a-sniffin' and he would goWas the best old hound dog I ever did know.
Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no moreDon't leave no message 'round her back door.They say the old laughing lady been here beforeShe don't keep time, she don't count score.You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall.You got to move there's no time left to stall.They say the old laughing lady dropped by to callAnd when she leaves, she leaves nothing at all.See the drunkard of the village falling on the street.Can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet.He loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet.But his laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep.There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night.There's a slipping on the stairway, just don't feel rightAnd there's a rumbling in the bedroom and a flashing of lightThere's the old laughing lady, everything is all right.

They say the neon lights are bright on BroadwayThey say there's always magic in the airBut when you're walking down the streetAnd you ain't had enough to eat The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere They say the women treat you fine on BroadwayBut looking at them just gives me the bluesHow you gonna make some timeWhen all you got is one thin dime And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes They say that I won't last too long on BroadwayI'll catch a greyhound bus for home they all sayBut they're dead wrong I know they are'Cause I can play this here guitar I won't quit till I'm a star on BroadwayOn Broadway, on Broadway

When the dream cameI held my breath with my eyes closedI went insane,Like a smoke ring dayWhen the wind blowsNow I won't be back till later onIf I do come back at allBut you know me, and I miss you now.In a strange gameI saw myself as you knew meWhen the change came,And you had aChance to see through meThough the other side is just the sameYou can tell my dream is realBecause I love you, can you see me now.Though we rush ahead to save our timeWe are only what we feelAnd I love you, can you feel it now.

No I'm not gonna,Hide my feelings,Couldn't if I tried.No, I'm not holding them inside.Holding back is,So close to stealing,Though we both have pride.We could lose it all if we lied.Someday it's later than,The feeling we have now.It's off the ground,I've always played around.But now I don't know how.Listen easy,'Cause I'm saying,What I mean this time.Sharing words I always said were mine.I was breezy,Now I'm swaying,Like the tree we climbed.Asking you to give me one more sign.

Once high on a hill, There was a song, Nothing was wrong, That's when time stood still.Now lovers are lost, Wrapped in their dreams, Tied in their thoughts,Bound by the depth of their love.If I could hold on to you.  If I could hold on to you.Somewhere near the end, Lovers pretend, Fake what they feel, Take what they get from love.Start losing the drive,Four out of five, Staying alive, Without the feeling of love.If I could hold on to you.  If I could hold on to you.If the sky is fire, And hell is blue, If all of our dreams won't come true, If the sky is fire, And hell is blue,I'll cover you, I'll cover you. Sky is fire, hell is blue.Sky is fire, hell is blue.That's why I'm out of control, Tear myself down, Build myself up,Tear myself down again.I'm talkin' to you, Trying to get through, Don't want to hide,Lost in the mirror of love.If I could hold on to you.  If I could hold on to you.

One day shots rang across the peaceful valleyGod was crying tears that fell like rainBefore the railroad came from Kansas CityAnd the bullets hit the bison from the trainShots rang across the peaceful valleyWhite man laid his foot upon the plain. The wagon train rolled through the dusty canyonThe settlers full of wonder as they crossedA gentle creek where two old oaks were standingBefore the west was won there was a costA rain of fire came down upon the wagonsA mother screamed and every soul was lost. Change hit the country like a thunderstormAncient rivers soon began to boilPeople rushed like water to CaliforniaAt first they came for gold and then for oilFortunes were made and lost in lifetimesMother earth took poison in her soil. An electro cruiser coasted towards the exitAnd turned on Peaceful Valley Boulevard"People make the difference" read a billboardAbove a long line of idling cars. Who'll be the one to lead this worldWho'll be the beacon in the nightWho'll be the one to lead this worldWho'll be the beacon in the nightWho'll be the one to lead the nationsAnd protect God's creations A polar bear was drifting on an ice floeSun beating down from the skyPoliticians gathered for a summitAnd came away with nothing to decideStorms thundered on, his tears of falling rainA child was born and wondered why.

Someone's hanging out,We can't forget about.Things that people doWhen they're free.Like visitors from space,It's hard to find a place,To blend in and go unrecognized.I'm waiting for a sign,I'm standing on the road,My mind outstretched to you.  I'm picking something up,I'm letting something go,Like a dog I'm fetchingThis for you.Pictures in mind:Rows of poppy fields,Harmony entwined,Changing gears that grind.Pictures in my mind.Pictures in my brain:Electrical energy,Fighting drugs with pain,There's a war inside.Pictures in my brain.I'm looking for a job,I don't know what I'm doing,My software'sNot compatible with you.But this I can't deny,I know that you can fly,'Cause I'm hereOn the ground without you.Angel without wings,Owner without things,SharpshooterWithout rings around you.The road we used to ride,Together side by sideHas flowers pushingThrough the dotted line.

Aurora borealisThe icy sky at nightPaddles cut the waterIn a long and hurried flightFrom the white man to the fields of greenAnd the homeland we've never seen.They killed us in our tepeeAnd they cut our women downThey might have left some babiesCryin' on the groundBut the fire sticks and the wagons comeAnd the night falls on the setting sun.They massacred the buffaloKitty corner from the bankThe taxis run across my feetAnd my eyes have turned to blanksIn my little box at the top of the stairsWith my Indian rug and a pipe to share.I wish a was a trapperI would give thousand peltsTo sleep with PocahontasAnd find out how she feltIn the mornin' on the fields of greenIn the homeland we've never seen.And maybe Marlon BrandoWill be there by the fireWe'll sit and talk of HollywoodAnd the good things there for hireAnd the Astrodome and the first tepeeMarlon Brando, Pocahontas and meMarlon Brando, Pocahontas and mePocahontas.

Day and night we walk these aislesIn the same old movie showAnd look for someoneTo feel for a while.There's matinees on SaturdaysWhen we sit in the velvet chairsPopcorn boxes fly through the air.Sad movies, they make you crySad movies make you wonder whyYou ever came.Do something to me,Don't make me waitStab something through me,Don't cry out the good thingsThat I appreciate.Day and night we walk these aislesIn the same old movie showAnd look for someoneTo feel for a whileThe light's go on, the movie's goneAnd the manager's up thereHe says he doesn't careAnd we take our money back.Sad movies, they make you crySad movies make you wonder whyYou ever came.

I could live inside a tepeeI could die in Penthouse thirty-fiveYou could lose me on the freewayBut I would still make it back alive.As long as we can sail awayAs long as we can sail awayThere'll be wind in the canyonMoon on the riseAs long as we can sail away.See the losers in the best barsMeet the winners in the divesWhere the people are the real starsAll the rest of their lives.As long as we can sail awayAs long as we can sail awayThere'll be wind in the canyonMoon on the riseAs long as we can sail away.There's a road stretched out between usLike a ribbon on the high plainDown from Phoenix through Salinas'Round the bend and back again.As long as we can sail awayAs long as we can sail awayThere'll be wind in the canyonMoon on the riseAs long as we can sail awayAs long as we can sail away.

How can I tell her that I love her,When windy week-end warningsTell me summer teases?When I first saw her with another,My world fell,And I stumbled for a while.I stumbled for a while.Whatever happened to Saturday night?Don't know what I'm going through,Look everything is new,Each time I turn around,Feels like I'm falling down.How can I tell her that I love her,When windy week-end warningsTell me summer teases?When I first saw her with another,My world fell,And I stumbled for a while.I stumbled for a while.Whatever happened to Saturday night?Back home, look around,Leaves falling on the ground,Changes since I've been gone,Don't know if I belong.Spoke to her yesterday,Couldn't think of much to say,She said that by the winter...She'd be gone...

How can I bring youTo the sea of madnessI love you so muchIt's gonna bring me sadnessI've never seen youThrough these eyes beforeNow I don't believe itI think I'll take itOr leave it.All I needIs your sweet sweet lovingFill my life with happinessAll I want is your heartEvery time I think of youMine falls apart.I went to heavenAnd I stood at the crossroadsI'll love you tomorrowAs sure as the wind blowsSilver rainOn the mountain cloverWashes awayUntil the music is over.
Last night I was coolAt the pool hallHeld the table for eleven gamesNothing was easierThan the first sevenI beat a woman with varicose veins.She stopped to seeHerself in the mirrorFix her hair and hide heir veinsAnd she lost the game.Next day I went to the dentistHe pulled some teethAnd I lost some bloodWe'd like to thank youFor the cards you sent usMy wives and I were all choked up.I recall how Caesar and CleoMade love in the Milky WayThey needed boatsAnd armies to get thereI know there's a better way.I saw the movie and I read the bookBut when it happened to meI sure was glad I had what it tookTo get away.Gotta get away, gotta get awayGotta get away, gotta get awayI'm making another deliveryOf chemicals and sacred rootsI'll hold what you have to give meBut I'll use what I have to use.The lasers are in the labThe old manIs dressed in white clothesEverybody says he's madNo one knowsThe things that he knows.No one knows, no one knowsNo one knows, no one knowsI'm sleepin' in every hallwayI just can't accept the staresI'm using too many coversI'm warm now so I don't care.I'm thinkin' of no one in my mindSedan deliveryIs a job I know I'll keepIt sure was hard to find.Hard to find. hard to findHard to find. hard to find
See the sky about to rain, broken clouds and rain.Locomotive, pull the train, whistle blowing through my brain.Signals curling on an open plain, rolling down the track again.See the sky about to rain.Some are bound for happiness, some are bound to glorySome are bound to live with less, who can tell your story?See the sky about to rain, broken clouds and rain.Locomotive, pull the train, whistle blowin' through my brain.Signals curlin' on an open plain, rollin' down the track again.See the sky about to rain.I was down in Dixie Land, played a silver fiddlePlayed it loud and then the man broke it down the middle.See the sky about to rain.
Five cheat card thief, misled skinhead,Tell me where it's at?Is it cool to bring it up again?Will I blow my cat?Misplaced tinselface, weekend pretend,Am I on your track?I would love to live close to you,Could I bring my cat?Cowgirl, sailor,Do you know who you are?Cowgirl, sailor,Do you know who you are?Do you know who you are?Overfed premed, outfront gaspump,Will I fix my car?Pinch yourself when I smile at you,Baby, I'm a star!Turned on, tuned in, cop out, sell out,Do you know who you are?I took the time to try to fit you in,Was I off too far?Cowgirl, sailor,Do you know who you are?Cowgirl, sailor,Do you know who you are?Do you know who you are?
I won't apologizeThe light shone from in your eyesIt isn't gone,It will soon come back again.Though we go our separate waysLookin' for better daysSharin' our little boy,Who grew from joy back then.And it's all becauseOf that love we knewThat makes the world go round.Separate ways, separate ways.Separate ways, separate ways.Me for me, you for youHappiness is never throughIt's only a change of planAnd that is nothing new.As we go our separate ways.Lookin' for better daysSharin' our little boy,Who grew from joy back then.And it's all becauseOf that love we knewThat makes the world go round.And it's all becauseOf the love we knewIt makes the world go round.Separate ways, separate ways.Separate ways, separate ways.
Someone's hanging out,We can't forget about.Things that people doWhen they're free.Like visitors from space,It's hard to find a place,To blend in and go unrecognized.I'm waiting for a sign,I'm standing on the road,My mind outstretched to you.  I'm picking something up,I'm letting something go,Like a dog I'm fetchingThis for you.Pictures in mind:Rows of poppy fields,Harmony entwined,Changing gears that grind.Pictures in my mind.Pictures in my brain:Electrical energy,Fighting drugs with pain,There's a war inside.Pictures in my brain.I'm looking for a job,I don't know what I'm doing,My software'sNot compatible with you.But this I can't deny,I know that you can fly,'Cause I'm hereOn the ground without you.Angel without wings,Owner without things,SharpshooterWithout rings around you.The road we used to ride,Together side by sideHas flowers pushingThrough the dotted line.
There ain't no way    I'm gonna let the good times go,There ain't no way    I'm gonna let the good times go,The touch of my woman    can soothe my soul,When she makes me feel right    that's when the good times roll.Oh she's a healer to me,Oh yeah.My blue-eyed woman is a mystery to me,My blue-eyed woman is a mystery to me,The touch of my woman    can soothe my soul,When she makes me feel right    that's when the good times roll.Oh she's a healer to me,Oh yeah.Way out on the prairie    where the wheat fields grow,Way out on the prairie    back where the wheat fields grow,I stop to slap plastic at an Esso station,About a thousand miles from my destination.Oh she's a healer to me,Oh yeah, she's a healer to me.All I got is a broken heart,And I don't try to hide it    when I play my guitar.My blue-eyed woman is a healer to me,Without that woman I'm history,My blue-eyed woman is a love ghost,Without that woman I'm toast.Oh she's a healer to me,Oh yeah, she's a healer to me.All I got is a broken heart,And I don't try to hide it    when I play my guitar.
Shining light, you always showed meYou always guide me. I don't know where I'm goin'Show me now. I'm waiting to see youI'm waiting to feel you around me againShow me your love. Show me your kind loveShare your compassion. Let me feel mineShed your light all around meNow that you've found me and I've found you[Chorus]Shining light, what will you show me now?What can I bring to you to stand in your glow?Shining light, when will you show your love?When can I see you and stand in your glow?Shed your lightShow your loveShed your lightShow your loveShed your lightShow your love[Chorus]Shed your lightShow your loveShed your lightShow your loveShed your lightShow your loveShed your lightShow your loveShed your lightShed your light
Back in the days of shock and aweWe came to liberate them allHistory was the cruel judge of over-confidenceBack in the days of shock and aweBack in the days of "mission accomplished"Our chief was landing on the deckThe sun was setting on a golden photo opBack in the days of "mission accomplished"Thousands of bodies in the groundBrought home in boxes to a trumpet's soundNo one sees them coming home that wayThousands buried in the groundThousands of children scarred for lifeMillions of tears for a soldier's wifeBoth sides are losing nowHeaven takes them inThousands of children scarred for lifeWe had a chance to change out mindBut some how wisdom was hard to findWe went with what we knew and now we can't go backBut we had a chance to change our mind.
ShotsRinging all along the borders can be heardStriking out like a venom in the skyCutting through the air faster than a birdIn the night.ChildrenAre lost in the sand, building roads with little handsTrying to join their father's castles together againWill they make it? Who knows where or whenOld wounds will mend?MachinesAre winding their way along, looking strongBuilding roads and bringing back loads and loadsOf building materialsIn the nightMenAre trying to move the borders on the groundLines between the different spots that each has foundBut back home another scene was going downIn the night.LustComes creepin' through the night to feed on heartsOf suburban wives who learned to pretendWhen they met their dream's endIn the night.ShotsI hear shots, I keep hearing shotsI keep hearing shotsI hear shots.ShotsI hear shots, I keep hearing shotsI keep hearing shotsI hear shots.But I'll never use your love,You know I'm not that kindAnd so if you give your heart awayI promise to youWhatever we doThat I will always be true.
When we go for a little walk,Out on the land,When we're just walkin' and holdin' hands,You can take it as a sign of love,When the winds of fate,Keep blowin' and we both understand,Sign of loveIt's a sign of loveSign of loveSign of loveWhen we both have silver hair,And a little less time,But there still are roses on the vine,You can take it as a sign of love,When I look at you,When I'm lookin' at you for a long, long timeIt's a sign of loveA sign of loveSign of loveSign of loveWhen I first saw you,You were just a girl,And I was a man,While the music played,I watched you dance,Sign of loveIt was a sign of loveSign of loveSign of loveSign of love
Workin' hard every dayNever notice howThe time slips awayPeople come, seasons goWe got somethingThat'll never grow old.I don't careIf the sun don't shineAnd the rain keeps pouringDown on me and mine'Cause our kind of loveNever seems to get oldIt's better than silver and gold.I used to have a treasure chestGot so heavy that I had to restI let it slip away from meDidn't need it anywaySo I let it slip away.I don't careIf the sun don't shineAnd the rain keeps pouringDown on me and mine'Cause our kind of loveNever seems to get oldIt's better than silver and gold.I don't careIf the sun don't shineAnd the rain keeps pouringDown on me and mine'Cause our kind of loveNever seems to get oldIt's better than silver and gold.

She lives in the TV skyShe lives in such painShe rides in a bulletproofStretch limousineThe smoke in the barroom nightsThe faces in the windowThe sound of the harbor hornShe recognizedAnd when the music startedShe just slipped awayJust like a river rollin' downAnd when the music startedShe just slipped awayHigh on a windy hillThe turbine did whineLow in the valley chillA baby was cryin'Impossible to take the timeThe moment is hereCry out from behind the pinesA voice comin' nearAnd when the music startedShe just slipped awayJust like a river rollin' downAnd when the music startedShe just slipped away
Something opened upThe gates again,I can't control it,So I rushed right in.Here comes a mermaidAnd a little girl,Saw open drawersFrom around the world.I got some medalsHanging on my chest,I've seen some good ones,But I missed the rest.Lady luck don't you turn on me,I'm just a student of your history,I'm just a student of your history.Slowpoke I'm gonna run with you,Wear all your clothes andDo what you do.SlowpokeWe got some things to find,When I was faster,I was always behind,When I was faster,I was always behind.Something pushed backThe curtain again,The stage is emptyAnd the crowd is thin.The song is gentle,But the song is now.Something's missing,But something is found,Something's missing,But something is found,Something's missing,But something is found.Slowpoke I'm gonna run with you,Wear all your clothes andDo what you do.SlowpokeWe got some things to find,When I was faster,I was always behind.When I was faster,When I was faster,I was always behind,When I was faster......
Time for me to show my handLet them know just who I am'Cause I've been down and back again.I'm so tired of talking to strangers,Close my eyes and I see the dangerI feel like making some changes.So tired of talking to strangers,Close my eyes and I see the dangerI feel like making some changes.

The flash of a distant cameraReconnectingThoughts and actions,Fragments of our missing dreams,Pieces from here and thereFall in place along the line,Disappearing between you and me.Life is changing everywhere I go,New things and old both disappear.If life is a photograph,Fading in the mirror....All I want is a song of love,Song of love to sing for you.All I need is this song of love,To sing for you.On the floor where daylight dancesWith the onesThat missed their chances,When they couldn't let it show,Lies the land of sweet surrender,Like a dreamIt might have ended there,But we didn't even know.Now forever we will live as one,Floating in love's atmosphere.If love is a piece of dust,Shining in the sun...All I want is a song of love,Song of love to sing for you.All I need is this song of love,To sing for you.Song of love...Song of love...

I went to the movie the other night,The plot was groovy, it was out of sight.I sat with my popcorn, out lookin' for good timesLost in the cartoon, I grabbed the lifeline.I've been a searcher, I've been a fool,But I've been a long time comin' to you.I'm hopin' for your love to carry me throughYou're holdin' my baby, and I'm holdin' you,And it's all right.Oh, tell me where the answer lies.Is it in the notebook behind your eyes?When your decision comes to view,I'll be watchin' my TV, and it'll be watchin' you.I've been a searcher, I've been a fool,But I've been a long time comin' to you.I'm hopin' for your love to carry me throughYou're holdin' my baby, and I'm holdin' you,Yes I am.Speakin' out.

I don't like to go down to flats'Cause I can't park on a hillInstead getting a rolling startI have to pay the bill.I guess I need that city lifeIt sure has lots of styleBut pretty soon it wears me outAnd I have to think to smile.I'm thankful for my country homeIt gives me peace of mindSomewhere I can walk aloneAnd leave myself behind.It's only someone else's potatoesYou pickin' someone else's patchAnd if you go down there anywayIt very seldom lasts.I found that out once long agoAnd it sure got me confusedI still don't know which way to goTo lose those old spud blues.I'm thankful for my country homeIt gives me peace of mindSomewhere I can walk aloneAnd leave myself behind.
I don't wanna get personalWhy have you put me on the spot?I don't know how you feelBut for me it's getting hardSwimming in the deep blue seaMarching in the big paradeAll I need is a little shadeStanding in the light of loveStanding in the light of loveDoesn't matter who you areOr who you're notAll it takes is a little loveTo make a handout worth a lotSwimming in the deep blue seaMarching in the big paradeAll I need is a little shadeStanding in the light of your loveStanding in the light of loveDrowning in the deep blue seaDrudging in the long paradeAll I need is a little shadeStanding in the light of your loveStanding in the light of loveStanding in the light of loveStanding in the light of love
Ain't it hard when you wake up in the morningAnd you find out that those other days are gone?All you have is memories of happinessLingerin' on.You might wonder who can I turn toOn this cold and chilly night of gloomThe answer to that questionIs nowhere in this room.All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you,They're only passing through you in the end.They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to,And wait for you to come back again.You might wonder who I can turn toOn this cold and chilly night of gloomThe answer to that questionIs nowhere in this room.Yet still a light is shiningFrom that lamp on down the hall.Maybe the star of BethlehemWasn't a star at all.
Our love, baby, feels so rightWhen you're smilin' in the morning lightI ain't leavin' no way'Cause we got stayin' powerYou and IStayin' power through thick and thin.Stayin' powerYou and IStayin' power through thick and thin.Gold and diamonds say you're mineBut true love opens the gates of timeAnd as we go on our wayWe got stayin' powerYou and IStayin' power through thick and thinStayin' powerYou and IStayin' power through thick and thin.
You can say the soul is goneAnd the feeling is just not thereNot like it was so long ago.On the empty page before youYou can fill in what you careTry to make it new before you go.Take the simple case of the sergeWho can't go back to war'Cause the hippies tore down everything that he was fighting for.Or the lovers on the blanketsThat the city turned to whoresWith memories of green kissed by the sun.You can say the soul is goneAnd close another doorJust be sure that yours is not the one.And I'm singing for the stringmanWho lately lost his wifeThere is no dearer friend of mineThat I know in this life.On his shoulder rests a violinFor his head where chaos reignsBut his heart can't find a simple wayTo live with all those things.All those thingsHe's a stringmanA stringmanAll those strings to pull
You're just a stupid girlYou really got a lot to learnStart living againForget about rememberingYou're such a stupid girl.You're such a beautiful fishFloppin' on the summer sandLookin' for the wave you missedWhen another one is close at handYou're such a stupid girl.You're such a stupid girl.I saw you in Mercedes BenzPracticing self-defenseYou got it pretty good I guessI couldn't see your eyesYou're really stupid, girl.You're such a stupid girl.
You are such a woman to meAnd I love youOur love with liveUntil the end of all time.No one else can kill me like you doNo one else can fill me like you doAnd no one else can feel our pain.Love is a healerAnd I love you.No one else can fill me like you doNo one else can kill me like you doAnd I love you.You are such a woman to me.

The painter stood before her work;She looked around everywhere.She saw the pictures and she painted themShe picked the colors from the airGreen to greenRed to redYellow to yellow in the light.Black to black when the evening comes.Blue to blue in the night.It's a long road behind me.It's a long road ahead.If you follow every dream,You might get lost.If you follow every dream,You might get lost.She towed the line.She held her end up.She did the work of too many.But in the end, she fell downBefore she got up again.I keep my friends eternally.We leave our tracks in the sound.Some of them are with me now.Some of them can't be found.It's a long road behind me,And I miss you now.If you follow every dream,You might get lost.
You`re still the childSuspended in spaceCrying out to youBeckons you to yet another fine placeWhere the trials of life are fewWho says you are coming onDon`t think you`re living longThey won`t remember youThe rent is always due.The cloudy menWho take their placeAnd stand in lineThey doKnow not ofThe satin faceThat separates them from youJust put your blue jeans onGrab your guitar and write a songDon`t think I`m kidding youThe rent is always due.She rides a broomWith gold-plated strawAnd flutters aroundAnd diesThe Bryl cream foolsJust standing onDigesting all their livesBut then you walk alongAnd she starts coming onBeneath her melting broomThe rent is always due.

They were hiding behind hay bales,They were planting in the full moonThey had given all they had for something newBut the light of day was on them,They could see the thrashers comingAnd the water shone like diamonds in the dew.And I was just getting up, hit the road before it's lightTrying to catch an hour on the sunWhen I saw those thrashers rolling by,Looking more than two lanes wideI was feelin' like my day had just begun.Where the eagle glides ascendingThere's an ancient river bendingDown the timeless gorge of changesWhere sleeplessness awaitsI searched out my companions,Who were lost in crystal canyonsWhen the aimless blade of scienceSlashed the pearly gates.It was then I knew I'd had enough,Burned my credit card for fuelHeaded out to where the pavement turns to sandWith a one-way ticket to the land of truthAnd my suitcase in my handHow I lost my friends I still don't understand.They had the best selection,They were poisoned with protectionThere was nothing that they needed,Nothing left to findThey were lost in rock formationsOr became park bench mutationsOn the sidewalks and in the stationsThey were waiting, waiting.So I got bored and left them there,They were just dead weight to meBetter down the road without that loadBrings back the time when I was eight or nineI was watchin' my mama's T.V.,It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode.Where the vulture glides descendingOn an asphalt highway bendingThrough libraries and museums, galaxies and starsDown the windy halls of friendshipTo the rose clipped by the bullwhipThe motel of lost companionsWaits with heated pool and bar.But me I'm not stopping there,Got my own row left to hoeJust another line in the field of timeWhen the thrashers comes, I'll be stuck in the sunLike the dinosaurs in shrinesBut I'll know the time has comeTo give what's mine.
Still glaringFrom the city lightsInto paradise I soaredUnable to come downFor reasons I'd ignored.Total confusion,DisillusionNew things I'm knowin'.I'm standing on the shorelineIt's so fine out thereLeaving with the wind blowingBut love takes care.Know me, know meShow me, show meNew things I'm knowin'.Wind blowing through my sailsIt feels like I'm goneLeaving with the wind blowingThrough my sails.

Out on the road the traffic slowed down to a crawlStrobe lights flashin' on the overpassThe tangled steel could not reveal what no one sawOr how he walked away without a scratchHe thought of her and walked along the exit rampHe touched the night between two old street lamps.And every one will touch the nightAnd every one will touch the nightAnd every one will touch the night.Imagine blue dissolve into the empty nightSlowly fadin' no one answerin'She walked away and left him standing all aloneBetween the shadows of his memoryAnd those who loved and lost will know the way it feelsTo touch the night without the one you love.And every one will touch the nightAnd every one will touch the nightAnd every one will touch the night.
Believe me,When I tell youThat a love trueIsn't hard to find.'Cause I found mineAnd she's so fineLike a lifelineFrom across the sea.None of the neighborsRemember names,They only see the facesWith destinations still unnamed.It's hard to leave the tracesFor someone to follow.

Frontier town,Home of the western heroFrontier justice,Dealt with the iron handHe wore a long coat to the groundHe wore big boots that made a soundHe wore a six gun on his hipBut now he doesn't carry itSure enough,He was a western heroOn the deck,Sighting an old Jap zeroAnd on the shores at NormandyHe fought for you,He fought for meAcross the land and on the seaBut now he's just a memoryAnd in the distance,The rocket's red glareThe bombs burst in the airThis timeWe're never going backThrough the yearsHe changed somehowHe's different nowHe's different nowOpen fire,Here comes the western heroStanding there,Big money in his handSure enough,He was a western hero,Sure enough
When we were living togetherI thought that I knew you would stay.Still when you left meI tried to pretend we could make it some way.I don't care if all of the mountainsTurn to dust in the air.(What did you do to my life?)It isn't fair that I shouldWake up at dawnAnd not find you there(What did you do to my life?)It's hard enough losingWithout the confusion of knowing I tried.But you've made your mind upThat I'll be alone now there's nothing to hide.I don't care if all of the mountainsTurn to dust in the air.(What did you do to my life?)It isn't fair that I shouldWake up at dawnAnd not find you there(What did you do to my life?)
Can't forget what happened yesterdayThough my friends say don't look backI can feel it coming through meLike an echoLike a photograph
How can I tell her that I love her,When windy week-end warningsTell me summer teases?When I first saw her with another,My world fell,And I stumbled for a while.I stumbled for a while.Whatever happened to Saturday night?Don't know what I'm going through,Look everything is new,Each time I turn around,Feels like I'm falling down.How can I tell her that I love her,When windy week-end warningsTell me summer teases?When I first saw her with another,My world fell,And I stumbled for a while.I stumbled for a while.Whatever happened to Saturday night?Back home, look around,Leaves falling on the ground,Changes since I've been gone,Don't know if I belong.Spoke to her yesterday,Couldn't think of much to say,She said that by the winter...She'd be gone...
Was he thinking about my countryOr the color of my skinWas he thinking about my religionAnd the way I worshipped himDid he create just me in his imageOr every living thingWhen God made meWhen God made meWas he planning only for believersOr for those who just had faithDid he envision all warsThat were fought in his nameDid he say there was only one wayTo be close to himWhen God made meWhen God made meDid he give me the gift of loveTo say who I could chooseWhen God made meWhen God made meWhen God made meDid he give me the gift of voiceSo some could silence meDid he give me the gift of visionNot knowing what I might seeDid he give me the gift of compassionTo help my fellow manWhen God made meWhen God made meWhen God made me
When I hold you in my arms    it's a breath of fresh air,When I hold you in my arms    I forget what's out there,All those people with their faces    walkin' up the street,They don't have to say a thing    just look around and you see.New buildings going up,    old buildings coming down,New signs going up,    old signs coming down,You gotta hold onto something in this life.Well the older generation    they got something to say,But they better say it fast    or get outta the way.All those gangsters with their crimes    they make it look so good,We've been blowing up the planet    just like the old neighbourhood.New buildings going up,    old buildings coming down,New signs going up,    old signs coming down,You gotta hold onto something in this life.If I only had a heart    it would beat all night for you,If I only had a heart    I would cry the whole day through,When I hold you in my arms    it's like a breath of fresh air,When I hold you in my arms    I forget what's out there.Old heart's going up,    old heart's coming down,My feelings going up,    my feelings coming down,You gotta hold onto someone in this life.When I hold you in my arms    it's a breath of fresh air.When I hold you in my arms    I forget what's out there.
Selling papers on the corner,I saw a man yesterday.I asked him if he'd wannaTell me what made him this way.He said, when it's born, it's warm,Then it gathers strength in lies,When it falls, it falls all over you.He used to pick his friends.They left him in the end.An easy thing to lose,The right to pick and choose.When it's born, it's warm,Then it gathers strength in lies,When it falls, it falls all over you.He said he left his wife,The back-bone of his life.Another came along,But now I guess she's gone.When it's born, it's warm,Then it gathers strength in lies,When it falls, it falls all over you.I think I used to seeThat old man on TV,Can you be the same?It seems like such a shame.When it's born, it's warm,Then it gathers strength in lies,When it falls, it falls all over you.The world he thought he knew,Has better things to do.As I went on my wayI thought I heard him say:When it's born, it's warm,Then it gathers strength in lies,When it falls, it falls all over you.

I went into town to see youYesterdayBut you were not home.So I talked to some old friendsFor a whileBefore I wandered off alone.It's so hard for me nowBut I'll make it somehow,Though I know I'll never be the same.Won't you ever change your ways,It's so hard to make love payWhen you're on the losing end,And I feel that way again.Well, I miss you more than ever,Since you've goneI can hardly maintain.Things are different round hereEvery night,My tears fall down like rain.It's so hard for me nowBut I'll make it somehow,Though I know I'll never be the same.Won't you ever change your ways,It's so hard to make love payWhen you're on the losing end,And I feel that way again.
I would be feelin' so lowShe'd have a new place to goShe'd take me in her armsAnd show me all her charmsUntil my troubles were gone.Then when I left her behindNever a tear could I findJust a haunting melodyComin' back to meWhere is the highway tonight?Where is the highway tonight?Where are those old days and crazy nights?Now the house is all quiet and stillCoyote house on the hillHow far did I goBefore we said helloWhere is the highway tonight?Darlin', you'll always be mineI'll never treat you unkindBut a haunting melodyKeeps comin' back to meWhere is the highway tonight?Where is the highway tonight?Where are those old days and crazy nights?A haunting melodyKeeps comin' back to meWhere is the highway tonight?
Winding pathsThrough tables and glassFirst fall was newNow watch the summer passSo close to you.Too late to keep the change,Too late to pay,No time to stay the sameToo young to leave.No pass out sign on the doorSet me thinkingAre waitresses paying the priceOf their winking?While stars sit in bars and decideWhat their drinking,They drop by to die 'cause it'sFaster than sinking.Too late to keep the change,Too late to pay,No time to stay the sameToo late to keep the change,Too late to pay,No time to stay the sameToo young to leave.Find out that now was the answerTo answers that you gave laterShe did the thingsThat we both did before, now,But who forgave her.If I could stand to see her cryingI would tell her not to care.When she learns of all your lyin'Will she join you there?Country girl I think you're pretty,Got to make you understand,Have no lovers in the city,Let me be your country man.Got to make you understand.
I came to you,When I needed a restYou took my love,And put it to the testI saw some things,That I neverWould have guessedFeel like a railroad,I pulled a whole load behind.That old white lineIs friend of mineAnd it's good timeWe've been makingRight now I'm rollin' downThe open roadAnd the daylightWill soon be breaking.I was adriftOn a river of prideIt seemed like such aLong easy rideYou were my raftBut I let you slideI've been down butI'm coming back up again.And I'm rollin' downThe open roadWhere the daylightWill soon be breakingRight now I'm thinking 'boutThese things that I knowBut it's good timeThat we've been making.
It has often been my dreamTo live with one who wasn't thereLike an ocean fish who swam upstreamThrough nets, by hooks, and hungry bears.When the water grew less deepMy fins were aching from the strainI'm swimming in my sleepI know I can't go back again.Got the will to love, the will to love.I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,Never lose the will.It's like something from up above.I can be like a fire in the nightAlways warm and giving off lightBut there comes a time when I shine too brightOh, I'm just a fire in the night.And now my fins are in the airAnd my belly's scraping on the rocksI still think someone really caresAnd I'll keep swimming till I stop.Got the will to love, the will to love.I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,Never lose the will.It's like something from up above.I'm like a singer on the stageWith the golden lights and liquid rageDown from the mountains to the seaCool running love keeps cleansing me.It keeps my gills from getting dryBut it distorts things in my eyesSometimes I see what really isn't thereLike my true lover, and I care.Got the will to love, the will to love.I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,Never lose the will.It's like something from up above.Sometimes I ramble on and onAnd I repeat myself till all my friends are goneAnd get lost in snow and drown in rainAnd never feel the same again.I remember the ocean from where I cameJust one of millions all the sameBut somewhere someone calls my nameI'm a harpoon dodger, and I can't, won't be tamed.Got the will to love, the will to love.I'll never lose it, never lose the will to love,Never lose the will.It's like something from up above.Baby, if I see boredom in your eyesI'll know my river has run dryBut I won't turn back with that lonely tideI bought that ticket and I'll take that ride.If we meet along the wayPlease sway beside me, let us sway togetherOur tails together and our fins and mindWe'll leave this water and let our scales shineIn the sun above and the sky belowSo all the water and earth will knowIt has often been my dreamTo live with one who wasn't there.
The summer ends and the winter windsBegin to holler all around the bend.We will smile and sail awayThis won't be no sadness dayWhen the winter windsGreet the trees back there.We can watch the turbineTurning in the windUp on the ridge line,Before the fog rolls in.Falling leaves in the autumn airPeople feeling good everywhereWhen the winter winds greetThe trees back there.We can watch the turbineBlowing in the windUp on the ridge line,Before the fog rolls in.We will smile and sail away.This won't be no sadness dayWhen the winter windsGreet the trees back there.
I waited for you, Winter longYou seem to be where I belong.It's all illusion anyway.If things should ever turn out wrongAnd all the love we have is gone,It won't be easy on that day.Waiting to followThrough the dream light of your wayIs not so easy for me now.Half the time has passed awayThings we thought of yesterdayCome back now, come back now.Waiting to followThrough the dream light of your wayIs not so easy for me now.Half the time has passed awayThings we thought of yesterdayCome back now, come back now.I waited for you Winter longYou seem to be where I belong.
Someone's hiding out  who can't forget about  the things that people do when they're free.Like visitors from space  it's hard to find a place  to blend in and go unrecognized.I'm waiting for a sign  I'm standing on the road  with my mind outstretched to you.I'm picking something up  I'm letting something go  like a dog I'm fetching this to you.Pictures in my mindRow of poppy fieldsHarmony entwinedA changing gear that grindsPictures in my mind.Pictures in my brainElectrical energyFighting drugs with painThere's a war insidePictures in my brain.I'm looking for a job  I don't know what I'm doing  My software's not compatible with you.But this I can't deny  I know that you can fly  Cause I'm here on the ground without you.Angel without wings  Owner without things  Sharpshooter without rings...around you.The road we used to ride  Together side by side  Has flowers pushing through the dotted line.
I've been walking all night longMy footsteps made me crazyBaby, you've been gone so longI'm wonderin' if you'll come homeI'm hopin' that you'll be my babyI'm wonderin' if I'll be aloneKnowin' that I need you to save me.I've been talking all day longTo keep my heart from sadnessBaby, you've been gone so longI'm wonderin' if you'll come homeI'm hopin' that you'll be my babyI'm wonderin' if I'll be aloneKnowin' that I need you to save me.I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin',I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin',I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin',I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'.Well, I'm knowin' that I need you to save meKnowin' that I need you to save me.Knowin' that I need you to save me.Knowin' that I need you to save me.I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'.
Someone and someonewere down by the pondLooking for somethingto plant in the lawn.Out in the fields theywere turning the soilI'm sitting here hopingthis water will boilWhen I look through the windowsand out on the roadThey're bringing me presentsand saying hello. Singing words, wordsbetween the lines of age.Words, wordsbetween the lines of age. If I was a junkmanselling you cars,Washing your windowsand shining your stars,Thinking your mindwas my own in a dreamWhat would you wonderand how would it seem?Living in castlesa bit at a timeThe King started laughingand talking in rhyme. Singing words, wordsbetween the lines of age.Words, wordsbetween the lines of age.

You know I lose, you know I winYou know I call for the shape I'm in.It's just a game you see me play,Only real in the wayThat I feel from day to day.Although the answer is not unknown,I'm searchin', searchin', and how I've grown.It's not all right to say goodbye,And the world on a stringDoesn't mean a thing.No, the world on a stringDoesn't mean a thing.It's only real in the wayThat I feel from day to day.No, the world on a stringDoesn't mean a thing.

Well, you heard about the Great Pretender?I went to see him and he's not the sameDown by the club on the parking lot cindersI was to meet him and play his game.Yonder stands the sinnerHe calls my name without a sound.I saw his face in the attic windowYellin' down through the broken paneSinner man! What you got to run for?Church bells rang when he said that name.Yonder stands the sinnerHe calls my name without a sound.Well, I was about as scared as I could be.I went and hid behind the nearest tree.Peeked out from behind the branches.Sinner!Yonder stands the sinnerHe calls my name without a soundTo get down.I guess you heard about the Great Pretender?I went to see him and he's not the same.I guess you heard about the Great Pretender?I went to see him and he's not the same.
