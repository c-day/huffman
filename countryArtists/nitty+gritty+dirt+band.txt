High up on a rocky ledgeHoldin' all she's gotIt ain't much exceptThe shattered dream and broken heart He used her upMade her old before her timeShe's gonna take that final stepAnd leave her pain behind All the sins that men commit before their doneHer lover had one lying silver tongueShe won't speak his name, it's too much to bearBut I saw his face as he left her there Wooh oh ohohSure looked a lot like me (sure looked a lot like me)Wooh ahahah woohSure looked a lot like me He was just a boy barely 17Feelin' drunk and talkin' toughBut he wasn't really meanBumped into this sidewinderShould have backed wayGave him some lipTurned out they wereThe last words he would say All the sins that men commit before their doneHis killer backed into one smokin' silver gunNo one asked his name, nobody caredBut I saw his face as the blue smoke cleared Chorus Devil came and said, Sinner finally you are mineBut pardon me Mr. Devil but I think I need more time,I've got a lot of mendin' up in life to doThe Devil said, You should have thought of that,Before I came for you Take this rope and wind it once for every lieOnce for every thoughtless actAnd twice for tears they criedWalk 50 miles naked in the desert sunPraying for the souls that you have ruined, one by one No one knew his name, nobody caredBut I saw his face as he was hangin' there Chorus Chorus He sure looked a lot like me

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,That saved a wretch like meI once was lost but now am found,Was blind, but now, I see.T'was Grace that taughtMy heart to fear.And Grace, my fears relieved.How precious did that Grace appearThe hour I first believed.Through many dangers, toils and snaresWe have already come.T'was Grace that brought us safe thus farAnd Grace will lead us home.The Lord has promised good to meHis word my hope secures.He will my shield and portion beAs long as life endures.When we've been here a thousand yearsBright shining as the sun.We've no less days to sing God's praiseThen when we've first begun."Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,That saved a wretch like meI once was lost but now am found,Was blind, but now, I see.

A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see But like any other house it's only temporary Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart If there's no love inside it'll soon fall apart. Ashes to ashes, dust into dust Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust, Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on And so it goes with everything but love, So it goes, everything but love, so it goes. You can drive around in a long limousine If you don't know where you're going, you don't mean a thing He would walk a mile just to hold an empty hand He knows what it means to be a wealthy man. Ashes to ashes, dust into dust Colossus will crumble, bridges will rust, Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on And so it goes with everything but love, So it goes, everything but love, so it goes. Worldly treasures will all pass away There's just one thing's put here to stay Ashes to ashes, dust into dust Kingdoms will crumble, bridges will rust, Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry on And so it goes with everything but love, So it goes, everything but love, So it goes, everything but love, So it goes, everything but love.

In 1814 we took a little trip,Along with colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi.We took a little bacon and we took a little beans,And we fought the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.We fired our guns and the British kept a comin',There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.We fired once more and they began to runnin'On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico.Oh we looked down the river and we seen the british come.There must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on a drum.They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.We stood behind our cotton bales and didn?t say a thing.Old hickory said we could take 'em by surprise,If we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eyes.We held our fire till we seen their faces well,Then we opened up our squirrel guns and gave 'em a little, well, weFired our guns and the British kept a comin',There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.We fired once more and they began to runnin'On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico.We fired our cannons till the barrels melted down,Then we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round.We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind,And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.We fired our guns and the British kept a comin',There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.We fired once more and they began to runnin'On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico.We fired our guns and the British kept a comin',There wasn't 'bout as many as there was awhile ago.We fired once more and they began to runnin'On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico.
Nothing in this world such a pure delightAs a fais-do-do on a Saturday nightWork your tail off all week longBut forget about your troubles with a party and a songBoy I love those old time tunesThey can tickle your senses like a Cajun moonCreole food sure tastes fineWhen you wash it on down with that homemade wine[CHORUS:]Get out the fiddle rosin up the bowThere's gonna be some music and I hope it ain't slowGrab your baby dance 'til three down at the Bayou JubileeGrab your baby dance 'til three down at the Bayou JubileeThere's Pierre and his girl LaverneDancin' so hot you'd think their shoes were burningGrandma's in the corner shakin' it tooShe's got her own version of a Cajun boogaloo (repeat chorus)
Here on the hilltop where we fell in love Many moons later, now we're giving up I start the engine, you start to cry It's a beautiful memory but a sad sad goodbye. How many times have we wished on a star, Wrapped up in a quilt on the hood of my car We saw Halley's comet in lunar eclipse And I sure saw heaven when I tasted your lips. So blow out the stars, turn off the moon Fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind Another love story has come to an end When our love was new as the first evening star We both said I'll worship you just as you are Then I tried to change you, girl, and I don't know why You tried to change me, hey we might as well try. To blow out the stars, turn off the moon Fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind Another love story has come to an end. Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind Another love story has come to an end
I gotta bent up truck, gotta fix-it-upSo I set it on the backyard lawnPut the radio loud in the window I tuned it into rockNow I'm patiently waitin' on musicBut the DJ rambled and sangAnd it was blowin' in a brass skyBut it won't rain A bright-eyed woman on the hourBrings a glass of teaAnd I can tell she's as pretty as a flowerWhen she comes to meShe winds away the water From my eyes and soothes my brainAnd it was blowin' in a brass skyBut it won't rain And it won't rain for tryin' And it won't rain for beansThere's fear in the skyA big storm is what it means Waitin' out the weatherBy workin' on the truckWe get to hang out togetherCan't believe this luck Glass is fine by the hourBut don't match with mineIt got wrecked playin' sailor in the showerLast Christmas timeThe song's written in another languageBut the weather forecast is plainIt was blowin' in a brass skyBut it won't rain And it won't rain for tryin'And it won't rain for beansWell it's a bad day for flyin'But they won't fly with me Starin' at the boats and planesThat are stayin' on the groundAnother won't leave it's hidin'Til the wind turns 'round A bright-eyed woman in the kitchenCooks up a kiss of deathBoilin' up mango, crab and coconutAnd includin' cinnamon breadBut she drops the pan and saysParanoia is out and breeds like a runaway trainAnd it was blowin' in a brass skyBut it won't rain And it won't rain for tryin'And it won't rain for beansWell it's a bad day for flyin'They won't fly with me, noStarin' at the boats and planesStayin' on the groundAnother won't leave it's hidin'Til the wind turns 'round
Buy for me the rain, my darling, buy for me the rain;Buy for me the crystal pools that fall upon the plain.And I'll buy for you a rainbow and a million pots of gold.Buy it for me now, babe, before I am too old. Buy for me the sun, my darling, buy for me the sun;Buy for me the light that falls when day has just begun.And I'll buy for you a shadow to protect you from the day.Buy it for me now, babe, before I go away. Buy for me the robin, darling, buy for me the wing;Buy for me a sparrow, almost any flying thing.And I'll buy for you a tree, my love, where a robin's nest may grow.Buy it for me now, babe, the years all hurry so. I cannot buy you happiness, I cannot by you years;I cannot buy you happiness, in place of all the tears.But I can buy for you a gravestone, to lay behind your head.Gravestones cheer the living, dear, they're no use to the dead.

Looking out the window of this hollywood hotel,You'd never know that it was christmas eve.The billboards and the neon took the place of silver bells,And the temperature is 84 degrees.I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip belowAs the palm trees poke their heads above the sceneThere's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows,And santa drives a rolls royce limosine.But all along the rockies you can feel it in the airFrom telluride to boulder down belowThe closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhereIs a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snowI remember christmases when I was just a boyIn the morning I would run to see the tree.And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of christmas joyWell, I always thought they sang them just for me.Now the sun is setting in the california skyAnd I can't find the spirit anywhereSo I think it's time for me to tell los angeles goodbyeI'm going back home toook for christmas thereBut all along the rockies you can feel it in the airFrom telluride to boulder down belowThe closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhereIs a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow

She's historyNo one would give her a star on the walkShe'd have a hundred if pillows could talkWhere have I seen her before?She's the face on the cutting room floorIt's no mysteryActing in school at the tenderest ageLit up the room when she stepped on the stageCame to la for some moreShe's the face on the cutting room floorShe had visions of contractsAnd thousands of people in lineTo see her;Knocking on door after door after all of this time,Now she's not sureUp in hollywoodStayed with an agent she met in a barLaughed when he told her he'd make her a starWhere has she heard that before?She's the face on the cutting room floorOne night he told her that she'd never get anywhereIn her clothesThat's what it takes to play movieland musical chairsNow she knowsGoodbye hollywoodLeaving tonight on the 2:30 'houndSunrise or sunset she won't be aroundBut they'll replace her with so many moreShe's the face on the cutting room floorPoor little face on the cutting room floor

Sat here by this stony brook until the Grey day turned to dustWhen up swam a fish with a children's book thought that I was lostHe was on his way to the salmon hop, that's where they go to breedSaw me sitting on this log and thought I'd like to read[Chorus:]The night was cloudy but the moon he found a holeSaid that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to goWhy aren't you at the harvest ball with some sweet young galYou just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your palWell, I told him I was an orphan lived here all aloneBut many people have often tried to catch and take me homeThey never caught meThought that I was a hiding, call this log my homeBut the fish and the moon and a sweet young galAll want me for their own[Chorus]So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her roomWhile I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moonThe fish ran away with the moonThe fish ran away with the moon
Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonite,Shinin' thru the trees,Crickets are singin' and lightning bugsAre floatin on the breezeBaby get ready..... Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stump roadI'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knowsBaby get ready.....ooooooooooo You and me going fishing in the dark,Lying on our backs and counting the starsWhere the cool grass grows.Down by the river in the full moon light,We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the nightJust movin' slow... Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you... Spring is almost over and the summer's comeAnd the days are gettin' longWaited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you alongBaby get ready..... And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't biteJump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the nightBaby get ready.....ooooooooooo. Repeat the chorus (x3) You and me going fishin in the dark!
(Here we go) Same these days, I think about herDream up ways to live with out herWe made vows that I can not excuseYes forever don't last the way it used too We filled the church and hired a preacherI raised her veil to reach herLives on the promise of her youthBut forever don't last the way it used too Eternity can not be messed withThe law says you might confess toEnough coals, hotter hell you foolThen you swear an oath and then take it back, anytime you chooseThat forever don't last the way it used too Hammers, razors fill the trashYou throw'em out when you use the lastGet a new form son, don't become confusedIf forever don't last the way it used to Forever don't last, forever don't lastForever don't last, forever don't last the way it used tooForever don't last, forever don't lastForever don't last, forever don't last (Take a break)

One in a million in a lonely town, Two hundred people trying to keep me down, I've taken all I can, I ain't lookin' back. Small town boy in a back yard lot, Can't make a living with the luck I've got I'm gonna leave it all, I ain't looking back. That's the way I remember, it seemed to me when I was young. But I can still see the leaves slowly fall to the ground, And the snow on the trees as the winter comes down. Still I go home again in my heart. My father worked hard on the railroad track; Thirty seven years cut across his back, He gave it all he had for what he believed. Like every other kid that came before, I grew up believing there was something more And I still believe, I still believe. That's the way I remember, it seemed to me when I was young. But I can still see the leaves slowly fall to the ground, And the snow on the trees as the winter comes down. Still I go home again in my heart. But I can still see the lightning on a warm summer night And the rain on the roof when I close my eyes; I can still hear us laughing on the front porch in the dark. There are days when I know that I've traveled so far That I'll never find the road leading back to the start, Still I go home again in my heart Still I go home again in my heart In my heart, in my heart

From rustler's rhapsody soundtrack, warner bros. 1985I'll drink a cold one with you and laugh the night away,'cause I ride hard when I'm working and I work hard when I play.But any misconception oughta stop before it startsI'll be leaving in the morning, girl,I break horses not hearts. I've broken records in the roundup, where I've broke a bone or two,But I won't ride away tomorrow and leave a broken heart with you.Tonight can't last forever, soon I'll be long gone from these partsYou won't hate me when it's over,I break horses not hearts. Your smile is so inviting and you're tender to a touch,And you're walking on the edge cause you're tempting me too much.When your home is in the saddle, boots don't fit beneath the bed,So when the sun comes up tomorrow, I'll be riding on instead. ChorusI've broken records in the roundup . . . .You won't hate me when it's overI break horses not heartsI break horses not hearts
Breakin' rocks in the hot sunI fought the law and the law wonI fought the law and the law wonI needed money 'cause I had noneI fought the law and the law wonI fought the law and the law won Well I miss my baby and I feel so badI guess my race is runShe's the best girl I've ever hadI fought the law and the law wonI fought the law and the law won Robbin' people with a six-gunI fought the law and the law wonI fought the law and the law won Well I miss my baby and I feel so badI guess my race is runShe's the best girl I've ever hadI fought the law and the law wonI fought the law and the law won
I like to drink my beer Spend time with the boys After work, to down a few Is something I enjoy And sometimes I stay out too late, Yes I know it's true But I love only you. And I like to take life easy Work out in the yard Sleep late on the weekends After an all-night game of cards And drivin' my old Chevy On a Sunday afternoon But I love only you I like my old guitar And I'd like to be a star and shine on you I'd like to write a song The whole world could sing along about I love only you I like my old memories The girls I used to know Some of them still have a place My mind likes to go Of all the ones I've cared for Lord knows that's been a few But I love only you Ah, Honey, I love only you.
I can see your heart is achingShe hurt you more than she knewShould you ever want to love againI'll be faithful to you You've been crying like the willowWhen the night bird sings so blueTrust was broken but hearts will giveAnd I'll be faithful to you In this world of pain and sorrowWhere a promise don't hold trueHere's a vow you can be sure ofI'll be faithful to you So let me dry away your lonesome tearsLike the sun melts morning dewAnd I will wrap you up in true, true loveI'll be faithful to you And I will wrap you up in true, true loveI'll be faithful to you
Sitting on the top of the world One summer day,She went away.She gone and left me,She gone to stay.But now she gone,And I don't worry.'Cause I'm sittingOn top of the world. Worked all the summer,And worked all the fall.I had to take my Christmas,In my overall.But now she gone,And I don't worry.Because I'm sittingOn top of the world. Goin' down to the freight yard,Just to meet a freight train.I'm gonna leave this town,Well it's just got too hard.But now she gone,And I don't worry.'Cause I'm sittingOn top of the world. One summer day,She went away.She gone and left me,She gone to stay.But now she gone,And I don't worry.'Cause I'm sittingOn top of the world. Henderson - Lewis - Young
Sleep deprived, an' fallin' apart.Starin' down your demons out there in the dark.At the end of the tunnel, you can see a light:Well, if that ain't a train, you made it through the night. An' it's a new day in the mornin':Anythin' is possible, it's all good.For brief shinin' moment,Everythin' is wonderful,Knock on wood.Knock on wood. Well, you get knocked down an' you get back up.You get knocked down again; well, it's just your luck, hah.It's just one of those years, that you gotta get through.An' then you wake up an' find, it made a man outta you. It's a new day in the mornin':Anythin' is possible an' it's all good.For brief shinin' moment,Everythin' is wonderful,Knock on wood.Knock on wood. It's a little humblin' down on your knees.Ah, but if you say: "Please." An' it's a new day in the mornin':An' anythin' is possible an' it's all good. (It's all good.)For brief shinin' moment,Everythin' is wonderful,Knock on wood.Knock on wood.
One parrot in a cageAt the home of a friendIs reason to wonder and stareGreen wings and red faceAnd a sapphire bellyA racket so loudAs to out shout the teleBut this morning, my prayerBy the side of the seaTook odds to turn backTo the moon in the treesWhere a green cloud of birdsIn a flock of a thou'Yelled from one to anotherIt's morning out loud"It's morning, it's morningIt's morning", they criedFrom the edge of the treetopsTo the edge of the skies"It's morning, it's morningIt's morning", they criedSo open your heartWhen you open your eyesAnd the sound of their voicesTogether did blendForming chords of awakeningIf I'm not here againFor they shoutedNever again would they flyIn such numbers acrossSuch a primitive skyAnd they noticed my heartAs it sank to the sandDo not hurry they calledIt's all part of a plan[Unverified]
I've been lookin' for a loveSomeone to hold as I lay sleepingI'm not talking about someone who's scared of promises or keeping upI'm just looking for a love to stand the test of timeI've been lookin' for someone to be all mine I had too much lonelyI need a one and onlySomeone I can care about and call my ownWell in true traditionWithout an intermissionWe'll still be together when the kids are grown. I've been lookin for a loveSomeone to hold as I lay sleepingI'm not talking about someone who's scared of promises or keeping upI'm just lookin' for a love to stand the test of timeI've been looking for someone to be all mine. (instrumental break) I've been lookin for a loveSomeone to hold as I lay sleepingI'm not talking about someone who's scared of promises or keeping upI' m just looking for a love to stand the test of timeI've been looking for someone to be all mine. I've been looking for some one to be all mine.I've been looking for some one to be all mine.I've been looking for some one to be all mine. I've been lookin for a loveSomeone to hold as I lay sleepingI'm not talking about someone who's scared of promises or keeping upI' m just looking for a love to stand the test of timeI've been looking for someone to be all mine.

My heart was warm with family love as I slipped into a Chair                     beside my uncle john, my daughters 'cross the table there                     I'd walked the docks in misty rain, a pain was in my legs                     but I'd seen the dream of kinsmen in the boats of Killybegs                     the banter of my uncle and my daughters filled the air and The                    gunning brothers?(Donegalers) next to us were glad that we Were there                     I was kind of quiet listening at the window ledge                     for the music of the harbor, the birds of Killybegs                     down the coast not far was Galway land of joys (Joyce) and Kinnamar?                    at their (after) supper and asleep we would visit? (be Goin') there tomorrow                     I worried if my words would e'er be sung by Irishmen                     or out (rot) here on the docks??                     like the fish of Killybegs                     a radio was playing though we never heard a word (I don't Think this phrase is right)                     but the rhythm of the music was familiar if absurd and harkning                     (a heightening) intensity? for silence did I beg                     oh what a song was playing in the air of Killybegs                     I couldn't quite believe it for it sounded rather strange                     the instruments were different and the key had been changed                     I reached to turn the volume up then teetered on my legs A girl from Tipperary sang my song in Killybegs                    a girl from Tipperary sang my song in Killybegs

The other night as I was drivingUp the highway through the pastI was torn betwwen the futureAnd the memories of the past Fell in love for the wrong reasonsGave our hearts then lost controlSo I eased it up past sixtyTurn away and let it roll We had the plan to stay togetherYou with your dreams me with mineWith the promess of foreverWe would stand the test of time Like the hot winds come in summerTrouble waited at the doorTime to leave this all behind meTurn away and let it roll ChorusLet it roll the way these heart achesLet it roll away theses fearsLet it roll away the reasonsWe've been crying all these years Every mile that comes between usThere's a cleansing in my soulThrow away the rear view mirrorAdios and let it roll Now everybody takes their chancesEverybody has to chooseBut when love hangs in the balanceThere's an innocence you lose I don't know what lies before meBut I'm sure I have to goFeel the tears slowly descendingIt's my last so let it roll Chorus...Time to leave this all behind meAdios and let it go
I packed my bags and bought myself a ticketFor the land of the tall palm treeAloha old milwaukee, hello waikikiI just stepped down from the airplaneWhen I thought I heard her sayWaka waka nuka nuka, waka waka nuka nukaWould you like a lei? eh?  Let's talk dirty in hawaiianWhisper in my earKicka pooka maka wah wahiniAre the words I long to hearLay your coca nuta on ma tikiWhat the hecka mooka mooka dearLet's talk dirty in hawaiianSay the words I long to hear It's a ukelele honolulu sunsetListen to the grass skirts swayDrinking rum from a pineappleOut on honolulu bayThe steel guitars all playingWhile she's talking with her handsGimme gimme oka doka make a wish and wanta polkaWords I understand Let's talk dirty in hawaiianWhisper in my earKicka poo ka maka wa wah wahiniAre the words I long to hearLay your coca nuta on ma tikiWhat the hecka mooka mooka dearLet's talk dirty in hawaiianSay the words I long to hear I boughta lota junka with my moolaAnd sent it to the folks back homeI never had the chance to dance the hulaI guess I should have knownWhen you start talking to the sweet wahiniWalking in the pale moonlightOka doka what a setta knocka rocka sis boom bocasHope I said it right Let's talk dirty in hawaiianWhisper in my earKicka pooka maka wah wahiniAre the words I long to hearLay your coca nuta on ma tikiWhat the hecka mooka mooka dearLet's talk dirty in hawaiianSay the words I long to hear
Life is like a mountain railway, with an engineer that's braveWe must make the run successful, from the cradle to the grave,Heed the curves and hills and tunnels, never falter never fail,Keep your hand upon the throttle, and your eye upon the rail.[Chorus]Blessed Savior, thou will guide us,Till we reach that blissful shore,Where the angels wait to join us,In God's praise for evermore.As we roll along the mainline, they'll be storms and they'll be night,They'll be sidetracks unexpected, on the left and on the right,But with the straight always before us, and our hearts upon the prize,They'll be no disembarkation until we reach paradise.[Chorus]
Matraca Berg, Jeff Hanna Little angel, are you lonely?Did I hear you calling?I will be there right beside youBefore night is fallingFor you I'd walk across the blazing sunAnd when my time on earth is done..... I'll fly, little angelI'll fly to get to youI'll fly, little angelI'll fly if you want me to Just as sure as the stars above usWe'll be togetherI'll give you love that's everlastingIf it takes foreverI know that I can't stop the hands of timeBut when it's up for you and I...... I'll fly, little angelI'll fly to get to youI'll fly, little angelI'll fly if you want me to,If you want me to Little angel, are you lonely?Did I hear you calling?I will be there right beside youBefore night is falling I'll fly, little angelI'll fly to get to youI'll fly, little angelI'll fly if you want me toI'll fly, little angelI'll fly to get to youI'll fly, little angelI'll fly if you want me to
There's a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterdayWhere friends and family gathered for the LordWhere an ol' fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow wayFor what few coins the congregation could affordDressed in all our Sunday best, we sat on pews of solid oakAnd I remember how our voices filled the airHow Mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notesAnd "When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll Be There"Looking back now that little mountain church houseHas become my life's cornerstoneIt was there in that little mountain church houseI first heard the words I based my life uponAt the all day Sunday singing, with dinner on the groundMany were the souls that were revivedWhile the brothers and the sisters who've gone on to GlorylandSlept in peace in the maple grove nearby
I can hear that old clock ticking, passing time up on the wall I can hear the faucet dripin in the kitchen down the hall to the one that I keep missing every night and every day There's things you learn to live with now that's all but I'll never get used to living without you Now I got used to tenderness, we would hold each other tight and I got used to happiness we'd make love day and night and I'll get used to mornings sitting in the evening when there's There's things you learn to live with now that's all I ever do but ill never get used to living without you Without you, the sun sill rises without you, the river run I thought by now that I'd be realizing what's done is done I accept the notion that there's things we can't control like the changin of the seasons or the fact we're growing old I know I'm the reason that you had to go away I will keep believing that s the price we had to pay chorus oh there's things you learn to live with repeat
Way back in my memory there's a scene that I recallOf a little run-down cabin in the woodsWhere my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn goldBut he laid awake nights wishin' that it would. When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.We lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion,With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your backMan, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong. But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,And somewhere in between I must have grownCause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'Takes me down the road to where I want to go. Now I know, it's a long hard road Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,When the sun-up came, we got up and wentIn the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spentSingin' songs along with gramma's radio. Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack,Livin' in my memories all in vain'cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's likeTo see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain. Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'Takes me down the road to where my name is known. Now I'm gone, and it's a long hard roadYes, I know, it's a long hard road.

There's no such thing as sleep for jealous foolsAnd being jealous about someone like youIs sort of foolish tooThe life you choose is the life you want I guessLosin' you might be the best thing yet The longest day I live I'll still be sufferin' from the shameWhile in the gutter you were makin' yourself quite a nameThe loneliness is all that I regretLosin' you might be the best thing yet Patiently I sit at home and wait,wonderin' where you areAnd what you are doin' has turned my love to hateI wanted you and you wanted anyone you could getLosin' you might be the best thing yet
There's a lost river that flows In a valley where no on e goes, Where the wild water's rush Rumbles deep in the hush. Gone far from there now, Lord I'll be back somehow To where the lost river winds In the shadow of the pines Oh, lost river, now I'm coming back To the pot-belly stove, where the firewood's all stacked Oh Quebec girl, go with me, Oh my bell, my fleur de lis, Where the lost river winds In the shadow of the pines Now every body knows Where that lost river flows It's someplace he's lost Behind bridges that he's crossed Well, he'd like to return, But his bridges are all burned And he's much too far down To return to higher ground Oh, lost river, now I'm coming back To the pot-belly stove, where the firewood's all stacked Oh Quebec girl, go with me, Oh my bell, my fleur de lis, Where the lost river winds In the shadow of the pines Oh lost river, far over the ridge Now is it too late for me to build me a new bridge? To the bright golden time When her love was still mine And the world was still wild Like the heart of a child Oh, lost river, now I'm coming back To the pot-belly stove, where the firewood's all stacked Oh Quebec girl, go with me, Oh my bell, my fleur de lis, Where the lost river winds In the shadow of the pines Where the lost river winds In the shadow of the pines

Well, I just want to clear the air,I already know, and darlin' I still care,But we're crippled every time I close my eyes.I know it's hard when you're all alone,And you always come back homeLooks like we're hurtin from your lovin' on the side I think I've prob'ly seen her, believe I know her name,Darlin' does it make you satisfied? She's the one who's feeling happy, I'm the one who wants to dieI think you've gone just a little too far this time. So I just want to clear the airI already know, and darlin' I still care,But we're hurtin' from your lovin' on the side I'm not saying that I approve, or that I can stand it,But I know I've got to give us one more try.I keep prayin' you still love me, but soon my prayer will die,If every time we talk, you hide your eyes. So I just want to clear the airI already know, and darlin' I still careBut we're crippled every time you close your eyesI know it's hare when you're all alone,And if you really want to come back home,Stop this hurtin', stop your lovin' on the sideStop this hurtin', stop your lovin' on the side.

The first thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin',And a youngun's dream of growin' up to ride,On a freight train leavin' town, not knowin' where I'm bound.And no one could change my mind but mama tried.One and only rebel child from a fam'ly meek and mildMy mama seemed to to know what lay in store,'spite all my sunday learnin' towards the bad I kept on turnin','til mama couldn't hold me anymore. And I turned twenty-one in prison doin' life without parole,No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried.Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I deniedAnd that leaves only me to blame, cause mama tried Dear ole' daddy, rest his soul left my mom a heavy load,She tried so very hard to feel his shoes,Workin' hours without rest, wanted me to have the bestShe tried to raise me right but I refused. And I turned twenty-one in prison doin' life without parole,No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama triedMama tried to raise me better but her pleading I deniedAnd that leaves only me to blame, cause mama tried
She'd slip away each day with the dimming lightAnd with the sweetest smile she'd kiss the child goodnightAt the mill she'd work her fingers till they were rawFor the sake of her son and the daddy he never sawMary danced with soldiersShe stepped a light quadrilleShawl across her shouldersTo keep away the chill, to keep away the chillIt was a rebel boy who brought her joy they sayThough the years had passed the memories stood fast each dayBefore a bullet crushed the life of their romanceHe gave her a shawl and a parasol from FranceMary danced with soldiersShe stepped a light quadrilleShawl across her shouldersTo keep away the chill, to keep away the chillThey came around to the tavern in town that nightAnd with silent cries Mary never tried to fightThey cut her hair and left her body tornHer spirit slipped away before the dawnMary danced with soldiersBut now her body's stillShawl across her shouldersTo keep away the chillMary danced with soldiersShe stepped a light quadrilleShawl across her shouldersTo keep away the chill, to keep away the chill

We met on the highway, she flagged me down, Had a flat on her Stingray with nobody around I helped her out, she said climb in So I ditched my ol truck just to see where the party would end. We spent the weekend in Reno in the honeymoon suite, Never saw the casino, barely took time to eat. I never dreamed she would take me this far But by Sunday that lady had taken a hold of my heart. It's a modern day romance, a new kind of game With no time to slow dance in the fast lane. I tried to love her without any strings But a modern day romance has left me some old-fashioned pain. She never said good-bye, just a note by the phone Said ";thanks for the good times, but it's time to move on."; Well I'm out here walkin' with my thumb in the air Wondering where she might've gone and why I even care. It's a modern day romance; old fashioned pain

For as long as I remember, when Friday night came 'round The family would gather out at Grandpa's houseWith supper over and the dishes done It was then the best time came At an old upright piano that only Grandma played[Chorus:]She played "Beautiful Dreamer," "My Wild Irish Rose"She never played 'em perfect, but there was love in every noteGrandpa sat beside her, in harmony they sangAt the old upright piano that only Grandma playedGrandpa was a stubborn man, they said it was his styleGrandma called him ornery, but she said it with a smileEven he could not disguise the love he felt so strongWe all could see it in his eyes when she played his favorite song[Chorus]I was almost seventeen when my Grandma diedI stayed all night with Grandpa; the old man never criedHe sat at her piano, there was nothing we could say It was the first time in my life I ever heard my Grandpa playIt wasn't "Beautiful Dreamer" or "My Wild Irish Rose"It was a song he played from memory, he never missed a noteI sat right there beside him until the morning came"What a Friend We Have in Jesus" was the only song he played[Chorus]

I made a living writing lover's dream words,I found the notes to hang them onI fround a way to play with the meaning of thingsAnd I came up with a couple good songs.And so I oughta have an easy answer,I oughta have some pretty things to say,But I haven't found the combinationThat'll make you change your mind and wanna stay.So I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over againSung in tune and time to a melody pureOne clear everpresent pulse in the pocketAnd I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yoursListen to the laughter of the childrenShe scratched on the back of a billAs we climbed past the road to the schoolhouseOn the burnt crust browning pan hillTo where they don't take sad for an answer,A place at the corner of your heart,Where music meets with memories,So you can recognize the feeling from the startHow I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over againSung in tune and time to a melody pureOne clear everpresent pulse in the pocket?I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yoursThey'll put us on the radio so you'll know that I am yours
Watch out when they start to twistHold tight with a leather fistThat's what my daddy told meHow to ride the bulls.There's a jingle in my jeans,Short places inbetween;I'm leaving tennesee with a push and pull.Ten-four, buddy, come on back.Horse trailer on a cadillac,You're talking to the cowboy in the coupe de ville.Chug a lug up one side, glide down the other,I'm a lover of the other side of the hill.Turn up that radio & don't think about rodeo,Don't think about roundup up in old cheyenne.It's a crazy circuit, but you still work it.Won't you turn the sound up and let's check the scan.Ten-four, buddy, come on back.Horse trailer on a cadillac,You're talking to the cowboy in the coupe de ville.Chug a lug up one side, glide down the other,I'm a lover of the other side of the hill.Bandanna on the rearview mirrorStill wet from ear to ear;Once again it's provin' what the wise men say -When you ride the last one, you better make it a fast oneJump while he's movin, just walk away.Ten-four, buddy, come on back.Horse trailer on a cadillac,You're talking to the cowboy in the coupe de ville.Chug a lug up one side, glide down the other,I'm a lover of the other side of the hill.
The promoter says he wants to cancelCause there ain't enough tickets soldThe air conditioner on the bus just brokeAnd I cant shake this coldThe single lost the bullet,The singers losin' his wifeWell I might be crazy but I wouldn't changeA single thing about this life.Sometimes we feel like champions,Sometimes we just cant win,Sometimes our records hit the top of the chartsOr the discount bargain bins.[Chorus]Through 30 years of touringWe've remained partners, brothers, and friendsWe keep it together cause we love it and were sureWell be big time before it all ends.Well you know you've got the nitty grittyAnd jimmy's got his drums alongThen Jeffrey and me and bobby will beSinging all our favorite songsCatch the fire from the folks in the front rowFan the flames as the beat gets strongIts great to be a part of somethingSo good that's lasted so longWell I saw a story in the paperSuddenly the bands big newsThe critics all like our records just fineBut they seem a bit confusedIs it folk or rock or countrySeems like everybody cares but usSo just leave us an early wake up callSo we don't miss the bus[Chorus]The band says it cant stand my latest song, its too personalBut my first wife's second marriage blew upShe had to get the dang thing annulledWell if that ain't something to sing aboutWell you tell me what isAnd well give it a beat and put it on the streetAnd we just might have another hit[Chorus]

Well, she saved him from whiskey,Was his constant companion.You'd see them out riding at dawn.She gave him his reasons To shoulder the seasons,But now when you see himHe's riding alone.She lay down beside himTo touch him and guide him,Turn 'round his headOn the darkest of days.He still sits beside her,Remembers her smilingAnd whisper to himThat old song he would play.Please lay down beside me,I love you.Never wanted to bid this adieu.No red river ever ran deeperThan an old cowboy love,Than an old cowboy love that runs true.
I've got ripplin' water to wake me To the mornin', my woman, and love.Tall pine trees are pointin' us easily to heaven above.Blue spruce clinin' to the grade in the eveningThey take the chill away fine.Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.There's a worn red chair by the window That we found at a sale down the wayWhen some old women said that they needed more room for the winter.People like pullin' at the stuffin' when they sit down.It helps passin' the time.Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.And oh, like a bubble on a windy dayI start to flutter when I hear you sayThat you feel to good to go away.And you make me feel fine.And you make my world a warmer placeBy the sparklin' of your diamond face.On a frayed spot put a little lace.And you make me feel fine.Warm as the mountain sunshineOn the edge of the snow lineIn a meadow of columibine.Oh little Jennifer, I'd give a penny forWhat you got on your mind.Seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'.Maybe in your visions you've seen how omniscient is Slightly less than devine.Cut the telephone line and the story's the same.Ripplin' water's flowin' through the pipes In the walls that are keepin' me warm.The closest I've been to my family for days is my music.Silently starin' at the mornin' skyIt's just like hearin' her callin' my name.Cut the telephone line and the story might change.And oh, like a bubble on a windy dayI start to flutter when I hear you sayThat you feel to good to go away.And you make me feel fine.And you make my world
Wish that I was on ole rocky top,Down in the Tennessee hills.Ain't no smoggy smoke on rocky top,Ain't no telephone bills.Once there was a girl on rocky top,Half bear the other half cat.Wild as a mink, sweet as soda pop,I still dream about that.Rocky top, you'll always beHome sweet home to me.Good ole rocky top,Rocky top Tennessee, rocky top Tennessee.Once two strangers climbed on rocky top,Lookin' for a moonshine still.Strangers ain't come back from rocky top,Guess they never will.Corn won't grow at all on rocky top,Dirt's too rocky by far.That's why all the folks on rocky topGet their corn from a jar.Rocky top, you'll always beHome sweet home to me.Good ole rocky top,Rocky top Tennessee, rocky top Tennessee.Now I've had years of cramped up city life,Trapped like a duck in a pen.Now all I know is it's a pity lifeCan't be simple again.Rocky top, you'll always beHome sweet home to me.Good ole rocky top,Rocky top Tennessee, rocky top Tennessee.Rocky top Tennessee, rocky top Tennessee.Yeah rocky top Tennessee eee eee eee.

Christopher Robin and I walked along,Under branches lit up by the moon.Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore,As the days disappeared far too soon.Now I wandered much further today than I should,And I can't find my way to the three-acre wood.So help me if you can, I've got to get Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one. You'll be surprised, there's so much to be done, Count all the bees in the hive, Chase all the clouds from the sky, Back to the days of Christopher Robin, And Pooh. Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do, Got a honey jar stuck on his nose. He came to me asking help and advice, And from here no one knows where he goes. So I went in to ask of the Owl, if he's there, How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear. So help me if you can I've got to get, Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one. You'll be surprised there's so much to be done, Count all the bees in the hive, Chase all the clouds from the sky, Back to the days of Christopher Robin, Back to the ways of Christopher Robin, And Pooh.

All you wanted was a one night standThe fire of the wine and the touch of a manBut I fell in love and ruined all of your plansSo what'll you do about me?  Imagine the faces on your high class friendsWhen I beat on the door and I beg to come inScreaming "come on, love me again"What'll you do about me?  You can change your number,You can change your nameYou can ride like hell on a midnight trainThat's all right mama that's okWhat'll you do about me Picture your neighbors when you try to explainThat good old boy standing out in the rainWith his nose on the windowpaneLady, what'll you do about me?  And what in the world are you planning to doWhen a man comes over just to visit with youAnd I'm on the porch with a 2 by 2Tell me what'll you do about me You can call your lawyerYou can call the fuzzYou can sound the alarm, wake the neighbors upThere ain't no way to stop a man in loveWhat'll you do about me All you wanted was a one night standThe fire of the wine and the touch of a manBut I fell in love and baby here I amWhat'll you do about me?  You can change your number, you can change your nameYou can ride like hell on a midnight trainThat's all right mama that's okBut what'll you do aboutWhat'll you do about meWhat'll you do about me
Oh the the night is so still, not a baby will cryNot a chill wind will blow, disturbing the skyBut there's no peace in me, I'm burning for youI'm walking the floor in the devil's shoes.When I get my rewards, I will bring them to youI shall ask for your love, and swear mine is trueWill you cast me aside, and see me no more?How can I win your heart when I get my rewards?They say that your hair can never touch mineThat a poor boy can't hope for a woman so fineBut I work till I fall, determined to winDriven by need to see you again
I want to stand upon a rock, and watch the river flow With the blue sky above me and the valley down below. I want to hold my head up high, and listen to the wind Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again I want to sing the kind of songs that my dad sang to me, And try to be the man he hoped that I would be He said you only get one chance, you'd better do the best you can, Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again. I want to wear my Sunday coat, and hold your hand in mine, And hear you say you'll love me until the end of time. I want to find forever in every moment that we spend, Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again. I want to wear my Sunday coat And hold your hand in mine And hear you say you'll love me Until the end of time I want to stand upon a rock, like I did when I was young, And hold you close beside me, and watch our children run Cause you only get one chance to listen to th wind, And when it's gone, it won't be back again We only get one chance, so listen to the wind, Cause when it's gone, it won't be back again.

Who did you say it was brother?Who was it who fell by the way?When whiskey and blood run togetherDid you hear anyone pray? I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brotherI didn't hear nobody prayI heard the crash on the highwayBut I didn't hear nobody pray When I heard the crash on the highwayI knew what it was from the startI went to the scene of destructionAnd a picture was stamped on my heart There was whiskey and blood all togetherMixed with glass where they layDeath played her hand in destructionBut I didn't hear nobody pray I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brotherI didn't hear nobody prayI heard the crash on the highwayBut I didn't hear nobody pray I wish I could change this sad storyThat I am now telling youBut there is no way I can change itFor somebody's life is now through Their soul has been called by the MasterThey died in a crash on the wayAnd I heard the groans of the dyingBut I didn't hear nobody pray I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brotherI didn't hear nobody prayI heard the crash on the highwayBut I didn't hear nobody pray
