It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the squareThey were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was thereOn my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot redAnd he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby thereShe was stretched out on a long white table, So sweet, cool and so fair Let her go, let her go, God bless herwherever she may be... She may search this whole wide world overnever find a sweeter man as me...  When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hatput a 20 dollar gold piece on my watch chainThe gang'll know I died standing pat Let her go, let her go God bless herWherever she may beShe may search this wide world overNever find a sweeter man as me I want 6 crapshooters to be my pallbearers3 pretty women to sing a songStick a jazz band on my hearse wagonRaise hell as I stroll along Let her go Let her goGod bless herWherever she may beShe may search this whole wideworld overShe'll never find a sweeterMan as me...
I hate to see that evening sun go downI hate to see that evening sun go downCause my baby, he's gone left this townFeelin' tomorrow like I feel todayIf I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel todayI'll pack my truck and make my give-a-waySt. Louis woman with her diamond ringPulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and herThat man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhereI got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can beThat man's got a heart like a rock cast in the seaOr else he wouldn't have gone so far from meI love my baby like a school boy loves his pieLike a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n ryeI love my man till the day I die
