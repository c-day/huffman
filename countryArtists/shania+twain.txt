Back through the years I go wandering once againBack to the seasons of my youthI recall a box of rags that someone gave usAnd how my mama put the rags to useThere were rags of many colors and every piece was smallAnd I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fallMomma sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love she made my coat of many colors that I was so proud ofAs she sewed she told a story from the bible she had readAbout a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she saidPerhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happinessAnd I just couldn't wait to wear it and mama blessed it with a kissMy coat of many colors that my mama made for meMade only from rags but I wore it so proudlyAlthough we had money but I was rich as I could be in my coat of many colorsMy mama made for meSo with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoesIn my coat of many colors I hurried off to schoolJust to find the others laughing and a making fun of meIn my coat of many colors my mama made for meAnd oh I couldn't understand for I felt I was richAnd I told them all the love my mama sewed in every stichAnd I told them all the story mama told me while she sewedAnd how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothesBut they didn't understand and I tried to make them seeOne is only poor only if they choose to beNow I know we have no money but I was rich as I could beIn my coat of many colors mama made for meMade just for me

She's faced the hardest times you could imagineAnd many times her eyes fought back the tearsAnd when her youthful world was about to fall inEach time her slender shouldersbore the weight of all her fearsAnd a sorrow no one hearsstill rings in midnight silence in her ears Let her cry, for she's a ladyLet her dream, for she's a childLet the rain fall down upon herShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild And if by chance I should hold herLet me hold her for the timeBut if allowed just one possessionI would pick her from the garden to be mine.  Be careful how you touch her for she'll awakenAnd sleep's the only freedom that she knowsAnd when you walk into her eyes you won't believeThe way she's always payingfor debts she never owesAnd a silent wind still blowsthat only she can hear and so she goes  Let her cry, for she's a ladyLet her dream, for she's a childLet the rain fall down upon herShe's a free and gentle flower growing wild
