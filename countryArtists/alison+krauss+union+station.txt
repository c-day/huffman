So you're on your own lookin' down the road that goes only by one wayAnd you don't need the signs to see lonely still runs both waysSo who's the fool that would think the ties would be better off undoneDid your heart even warn you when you veered from the path that was narrower and straightOn the borderlineSomewhere between the flight for freedomFeeling like you can't move onThe chore will be the timeTakes you off of my mind and out of my heart I knowAnd when you cross over there's no turning backOnce that burning bridge is goneI may lose but I'm in it for the long runLoving you for good reason could be the wrong oneI don't want to lose control but the heart won't learnTo let it well enough for longOn the borderlineSomewhere between the flight for freedomFeeling like you can't move onThe chore will be the timeTakes you off of my mind and out of my heart I knowAnd when you cross over there's no turning backOnce that burning bridge is goneSo you're on your own lookin' down the road that goes only by one way
From the bright sunny south to the war, I was sent,E'er the days of my boyhood, I scarcely had spent.From it's cool shady forests and deep flowing streams,Ever fond in my mem'ry and sweet in my dreams.Oh, my dear little sister, I still see her tears.When I had to leave home in our tender years.And my sweet gentle mother, so dear to my heart,It grieved me sincerely when we had to part.Said my kind-hearted father as he took my hand:"As you go in defence of our dear native land,"Son, be brave but show mercy whenever you can."Our hearts will be with you, 'til you 'turn again."In my bag there's a bible to show me the way,Through my twelfth year on earth and to Heaven some day.I will shoulder my musket and brandish my sword,In defence of this land and the word of the Lord...
(sidney cox and suzanne cox/sidney lawrence music, administered by bug, bmi)I stood on faith and the corner of ambitionI came here to sink or swimAnd to show them all that they were wrongAnd though i never thought i'd make it this farSo the curtains are downFor the moment i'm someoneThere were those in the wings who waited, who came this wayNow there goneBut there's always someone at home who never forgets who you areWhen i'm down and i'm growing oldI won't be along no railroad trackI won't be bound to a life out in the coldIt's been a steady pace to keep my steps between these cracks on broadwayAnd my stride in rhythm to the beat of home, sweet homeWhen i'm down and i'm growing oldI won't be along no railroad trackI won't be bound to a life out in the coldIt's been a steady pace to keep my steps between these cracks on broadwayAnd my stride in rhythm to the beat of home, sweet homeCan't go on, i'm on the top of my better yearsI'm going home, it's too lonesome on the bottom rung hereIt's been a steady pace to keep my steps between these cracks on broadwayAnd my stride in rhythm to the beat of home, sweet home
When the mornin' sunStreaks across my roomAnd I'm wakin' upFrom another dream of youWhen I'm on the roadOnce again it seemsAll that's left behindIs a chain of broken dreamsBut you know that I love youYes, I love youOh, I love you.How I wish that loveWas all we'd need to liveWhat a life we'd have'Cause I've got so much to giveBut it seems so coldDown inside my heartThat the dollar signShould be keepin' us apartBut you know that I love youYes, I love youOh, how I love you.And if only I could findMy way back to the timeWhen the problems of this lifeHad yet not crossed my mindAnd the answers could be foundIn children's nursery rhymesI'd come runnin' back to youI'd come runnin' back to you.MmmmmBut you know we can'tLive on dreams aloneAnd to pay the rentI must leave you all aloneYou know I madeMy choice many years agoAnd now this travelin' lifeIt's the only life I knowBut you know that I love youYes, I love youOh, I love you.But you know I love youYes, I love youOh, how I love you...
I lit my love and watched it burn: Asking nothing in return.Except the lessons I will learn.From holding crazy faith.I've been touched by that bright fire.Down to the root of my desire,While the smoke, it rises higher.Glowing crazy faith.You're not asking if I love this man.I know you don't, you don't believe you can.Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:It tells me.Instrumental break.Am I a fool for hanging long?Would I be a fool for being long gone.When is daylight gonna dawn,On my crazy faith.The questions will not let me sleep,The dance is buried way too deep.But the bottom lover, lover's keep,Made by crazy faith.You're not asking if I love this man.I know you don't, you don't believe you can.Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so:It tells me.Instrumental Break.Love you're losin', those you love,Let the hope fly from the glove.Do not search the skies above.Search your crazy faith.Love is lightning, love is ice.It only strikes the lucky twice.Once or you will know the price.And once for crazy faith.You're not asking if I love this man.I know you don't, you don't believe you can.Yet I've seen the love open like a dancers fan.It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so.

I'm used to being alone.Except for six month playings without rings and phone bills that I've waited for.This is the life that I choose.I got no complaints if he is;If he ain't, I guess he'll send me a rose.Just don't ask me for the truth if you choose to lie honey.And don't try to open my door with your skeleton key.Some folks seem to think I only got one problem.I can't find nobody as crazy as me.I still love what I know.I love to ride alone and sing a song and listen to the radio.You can ride alone and if you change your mind, well, that's just fine,But there is somethin' that you got to know.Just don't ask me for the for the truth if you choose to lie honey.And don't try to open my door with your skeleton key.Some folks seem to think I only got one problem.I can't find nobody as crazy as me.Just don't ask me for the for the truth if you choose to lie honey.And don't try to open my door with your skeleton key.Some folks seem to think I only got one problem.I can't find nobody as crazy as me.
Daylight falls and I'm lost in the big parade.Hold my hand, darling, I'm afraid of the daylight.Shade is dark. Cool and languid for life or love.Safe in shadows; never stark as the daylight.As the daylight.When I was just knee high,My Momma told me, never try,To be someone that I am not.Yet over time I had forgot,The wandering child, so lost at play:He's found himself but he can't find his way,In the daylight.Oh, the daylight.Ooh, daylight.Ooh, daylight.Life is short, and there's no turning back the time.Fragrant meadows and lots to climb in the daylight.In my mind,There's a corner I need to turn.Lesson lived is a lesson learned in the daylight.In the daylight.I miss the forest shade,You took me there, the promise I made,To never leave the dark so deep.Safe and soothing, yet I fear,As I recall and now reflect,I see it's safer to connect,To the daylight.Oh, the daylight. (Light.)Ooh, daylight.Ooh, daylight.Instrumental break.Daylight falls and I'm lost in the big parade.Hold my hand, darling, I'm afraid of the daylight.Of, the day.Fade.

(mark simos/devachan music, bmi)Leaving is the longest word i ever learnedIn the time it takes to say it, the whole world has turnedIf a heartbeat lasts a lifetime then i've lived before`cause i remember standing at this open doorChorus:This path is not the one i'd choose to travelEven as we watch what tied us unravelAnd the tears fall like rainDeeper than crying, the loving still remainsNeither wants to be the one to say goodbyeAnd neither wants to be the one who's left to cryBut in our secret heart of hearts we both knowThat the time for patching up has passed and it's time to goChorusSo i'll be the one to pull our tangled lives apartI won't dodge the angry words that hide a broken heartAnd my calm fare-thee-wells cannot obscureThat deep inside, my heart is also hurtin' soChorus

When years seem like days to meNo time on my handsI run away to a place in meTo a faraway land.When home seems so far from meHeaven's lights look dimIt's just as far as my deepest heartWhere my heart's Father lives.His quiet voice speaking in silence everydayIf I will only listen to the words He has to sayI'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in my faceI will live, 'cause He will live in my place.When life seems so hard to bearWhen shadows look realThe circumstance is your Father's careGo by faith not what you feel.If you have been running tooStop now in your tracksTurn again to the one in youPut your burden on His back.His quiet voice speaking in silence everydayIf I will only listen to the words He has to sayI'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in your faceI will live, 'cause He will live in my place.When years seem like days to meNo time on my handsI run away to a place in meTo a faraway land...

I don't pick up the mail,I don't pick up the phone,I don't answer the door,I just soon be aloneI don't keep this place up,I just keep the lights down,I don't live in these rooms,I'm just rattled aroundI'm just a ghost in this house,I'm just a shadow upon these walls,As quietly as a mouse,I haunt these halls,I'm just a whisper of smoke,I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,That once burned out of control,You took my body and soul,I'm just a ghost in this houseI don't care if it rains,I don't care if it's clear,I don't mind stayin near,There's another ghost here,He sits down in your chair,And he shines with your light,And he lays down his head,On your pillow at nightI'm just a ghost in this house,I'm just a shadow upon these walls,I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does,I'm just a whisper of smoke,I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,That once burned out of control,You took my body and soul,I'm just a ghost in this houseThat once burned out of control,You took my body and soul,I'm just a ghost in this house

I left home when I was seventeenI just grew tired of falling downAnd I'm sure I was toldThe allure of the roadWould be all I foundAnd all the answers that I started withTurned out questions in the endSo years roll on byAnd just like the skyThe road never endsAnd the people who love me still ask meWhen are you coming back to townAnd I answer quite franklyWhen they stop building roadsAnd all God needs is gravity to hold me down
(music by viktor krauss, lyrics by michael mcdonald/genevieve music, ascap-moist `n' fudgy, bmi)With your love i was completeLike a haven safe from harmTill the bitter stole the sweetI was perfect in your armsA precious while i had your smileTill it all fell apart with one change of heartThe pain and regret will fade but a fact of love will still remainYou can't always trust happinessLove like a sweet parade till the saddest part when the music fadesYou can't always trust happinessIf a single star i seeEver made a wish come trueIt would bring you back to meBut the best my heart can doIs to love again, i don't know whenStill it's worth all i fear, the heartaches and the tearsLove like a lesson learned when we pass the point of no returnYou can't always trust happinessThere in love's steady glow hides the power to hurt us soYou can't always trust happiness
(marshall wilborn/flying pig music, bmi & happy valley music, bmi)Way up north where the snow flies and the sun don't hardly shineIf it weren't for my true love, i'd long ago lost my mindI'd long ago lost my mindThere's good folks here, good folks there, most everywhere i goBut the land of my heart is down where the snow white cotton growsWhere the snow white cotton growsWhen the river runs over from the melting snow, we'll take to the higher groundWhen the water goes down again we'll saddle our old paintWe'll be homeward boundMe and my love will be homeward boundHeartstrings hold tighter than the roots of a live oak treeHoldin' through tornado windsTougher than timber, stronger than steelThey'll guide me back southward againThey'll guide me back southward againWhen the river runs over from the melting snow, we'll take to the higher groundAnd when the water goes down again we'll saddle our old paintWe'll be homeward boundMe and my love will be homeward bound

I am a man of constant sorrowI've seen trouble all my daysI bid farewell to old KentuckyThe place where I was born and raised.For six long years I've been in troubleNo pleasure here on earth I findFor in this world I'm bound to rambleI have no friends to help me now.It's fare thee well my own true loverI never expect to see you againFor I'm bound to ride that Northern railroadPerhaps I'll die upon this train.You can bury me in some deep valleyFor many years where I may layThen you may learn to love anotherWhile I am sleeping in my grave.It's fare you well to a native countryThe places I have loved so wellFor I have seen all kinds of troubleIn this cruel world no tongue can tell.Maybe your friends think I'm a strangerMy face your'll never see no moreBut there is one promise that is givenI'll meet you on God's golden shore...
(michael mcdonald/genevieve music, ascap)It was so rightIt was so wrongAlmost at the same timeThe pain and acheA heart can takeNo one really knowsBut when the memories cling and take you thereTill you no longer careYou can let go nowIt's not right for meTo cling to youSomehow i just needed timeFrom what was to beIt's not like meTo hold somebody downBut i was tossed high by loveAlmost never came downOnly to landWhere no love is foundAnd i'm no longer boundI can let go now
(autry inman/tree publishing, bmi)Last night my dear the rain was fallingI went to bed so sad and blueThen i had a dream of youI dreamed i was strolling in the eveningUnderneath the harvest moonI was thinking about youThen we met out in the moonlightThe stars were shining in your eyesBut another was there tooI don't believe you've met my babyYou looked at her, you looked at meI wondered who you were taking toI shook the hand of your strangerBut i was shaking more insideI was still wondering whoYour arm was resting on her shoulderYou smiled at her, she smiled at youHer eyes were filled with victoryShe said "my brother wants to marry"And then my heart was filled with easeI knew that you would marry me

What a dying world redefinesThe reasons we strive to existRefrain control or we're bound to learnThe meaning of moments like this 'Cause in the peaceful lull, the quiet spellSeduced by the promise of blissWe soon forget that nothing's happened yetWe're living for moments like this So hold me, whisper gentlyThis is what we live for, how we learn who we areIt defines us, ever reminding usThat life never is more precious than this From the dim light in the greynessThe aim of the soul tends to missBut then the clouds catch fire and the oceans pitchWe're made for the moments like this So hold me, whisper gentlyThat there's nothing to fear, you'll always be nearTo remind me, stand behind meAlthough life can be rough, we can never give up It's in our power to face the stormWith all its fury and madnessThe flash of thunder will be harnessedWith the longing and sadness, the clouds will gray Hold me, whisper gentlyThis is what we live for, how we learn who we areIt defines us, ever reminding usThat life never is more precious than this So hold me, whisper gentlyThat there's nothing to fear, you'll always be nearTo remind me, stand behind meAlthough life can be rough, we can never give up

Don't expect too much from my poor old heart,You can blame me unforgiven for my scars,You might just be the best that I can find,But I can't seem to forget the tears I've cried,I don't know that I will ever trust again,It's a price I must pay for all my sins,Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,And my heart may be lost never to be found,Once upon a time I did believe,In my true love that swept me off my feet,The north wind of change swept him away,And left me drowning in my own painI don't know that I will ever love again,It's a price that I must pay for all my sins,Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,And my heart may be lost never to be found,I don't know that I will ever love again,It's the price that I must pay for all my sins,Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,I don't know that I will ever trust again,It's the price I must pay for all my sins,Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,And my heart may be lost never to be found.I don't know that I will ever trust again
My father was a farmerBut his head was in the skyHe worked everyday but Sunday'Til the day he diedHe prayed for rain and thunderAnd listened for the soundIn the dry years he went underHe never got off the groundWe all dream when we're youngerThat we will do great thingsMe, I used to have a hungerTo wear a pilot's wingsBut the circles that I ran inTurned my head aroundAnd the planes I had my plans inNever got off the groundDon't raise your hopesYou hear so many sayThe higher they getThe closer they are to flying awayFly away...Don't raise your hopesYou hear so many sayThe higher they getThe closer they are to flying awayThey say there but for fortuneIs the way it would have beenIf we could take a bigger portionWe'd fill our hands againYou see them on the sidewalksIn the parks all over townThose who've taken flightNever got off the ground
Stood out in the rain. Let it soak me down,Before I called you: I called you.You did not see me there,Hidden by the dark,Beneath your window,But I saw you.When putting on a face for the mirror on the wall.Dreaming that the looking glass is you.Catching my fondest gazes;Living through my fickle phases.I love you.Spend my time on 'phones,Tryin' just to talk,But you answer:You let it ring.Spend my nights alone,Catching fallin' stars,To give to you, love.They're just for you.Stars fall every time a lover has to face the truth.And far too many stars have fell on me.And as they trail the skies,And burn their paths upon my eyes,I cry.And it's getting easier, each day, to weep about you.Harder, every night, to sleep without you.How many years must I be,Driven by this dream of love with you?
(sidney cox/the sidney lawrence co.., bmi)Sad songs and teardrops will surely mend this broken heartTime forgets these bitter things i feelBut your days are numberedYou'll learn your lesson wellWhen you finally play a heart that plays for realThere's a new fool somewhere waitingFor your old fashion heartbreak love affairShe'll see through your intentionsWith each lie that you tellAnd the old ways will go out with the new some wayLeaving was so easyBut old hands do make fancy movesAnd i for one fell victim to your gameBut someday, you'll see that cold hearts can be broken tooWhat goes round must come around your wayThere's a new fool somewhere waitingFor your old fashion heartbreak love affairShe'll see through your intentionsWith each lie that you tellAnd the old ways will go out with the new some way

I've put it all behind meNothing left to do or doubtSome may sayBut every silver lining always seems to have a cloudThat comes my wayAnticipated pleasure or unexpected painNo choice I fearAnd love is hard to measure hidden in the rainThat's why you'll find me here all alone and still wondering whyWaiting inside for the cold to get colderAnd here where it's clear that I've wasted my timeHoping to fly 'cause it's almost over nowPeople come together, people go their own wayLove conquers fewAnd I'll do whatever, I'll say what I need to sayJust not for youHow many days should I smile with a frown?'Cause you're not around with the sun on your shouldersAnd how many nights must I wake up alone?And know in my soul that it's almost over nowOur love is like a paper airplane flying in the folded windRiding high, dipping lowAnd innocence is fair game, I'm hoping I can hold it inOur love will die, I know

Album: Cold Mountain Track: 08You'll walk unscathed through musket fire,No ploughman's blade will cut thee down,No cutler's horn will mark thy faceAnd you will be my ain true love,And you will be my ain true love.And as you walk through death's dark veil,The cannon's thunder can't prevail,And those who hunt thee down will fail,And you will be my ain true love,And you will be my ain true love.Asleep inside the cannon's mouth,The captain cries, ''Here comes the rout.''They'll seek to find me north and south,I've gone to find my ain true love.The field is cut and bleeds to red.The cannon balls fly round my head,The infirmary man may count me dead,When I've gone to find my ain true love,I've gone to find my ain true love...
