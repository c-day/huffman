Sing sweet and low a lullaby,Till angels say Amen.A mother tonight is rockingA cradle in Bethlehem.While wisemen follow through the dark,A star that beckons them.A mother tonight is rockingA cradle in Bethlehem.A little child shall lead them,The prophets said of old.And storm and tempest heed themUntil the bell is tolled.Sing sweet and low your lullaby,Till angels say Amen.A mother tonight is rockingA cradle in Bethlehem.Sing sweet and low your lullabyTill angels say Amen.A mother tonight is rockingA cradle in Bethlehem...

Oh the taste of wine and liquor and a woman's tender kissSure paints the perfect picture that's so hard to resistThough the lure of the old night life has always tempted foolsIt can't compare with what you stand to lose[Chorus]Remember the promise you wear on your left handCheatin's no companion for a real lady's manIf only I had listened to my own words of adviceAnd turned down the invitation in another woman's eyesFor the softness of a stranger, I threw good love awayFriend there ain't no higher price to pay[Chorus]

Looking back over the yearsOf All the things I've always meant to sayBut words didn't come easilySo many times through empty fearsOf all of the nights I tried to pick up the phoneSo scared of who might be answeringYou try to live your life from day to dayBut seeing you across the room tonightJust gives me away[Chorus]Cause the heart won't lieSometimes life gets in the wayBut there's one thing that won't changeI know I've triedThe heart won't lieYou can live your alibiWho can see you're lost inside a foolish disguiseThe heart won't lieLong after tonightWill you still hear my voice through the radioOld desires make us act carelesslyLong after tonight, after the fireAfter the scattered ashes flyThrough the four winds blown and goneWill you come back to me?You try to live your life from day to dayBut seeing you across the room tonightJust gives me away[Chorus]

I'd love to hear my daddy play once againAll the songs that he taught me when I was a kidJohn Henry, Ol' Shep and Faded LoveI Fall To Pieces and On The Wings Of A DoveJust a few chords on the banjo that was all he knewBut in the eyes of a child, man his fingers flewI practiced and I practiced til I got it rightPacked up everything and just took off one nightI made it from the beer joints to the Opry stageHe said the only difference is what you're gettin' paidHe didn't care that everybody knew my nameHe said it's all for nothin' if you don't stay the sameBut when he died the preacher cried and said he's the lucky oneHe's walkin' hand in hand in hand with God's only sonMy faith and common sense tell me the preacher's rightBut I'd love to hear the banjo ring for me tonightAnd I will honor my father with these words I write downAs long as I remember him he'll always be aroundAnd the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knifeI learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to lifeAnd the pain of losin' him cuts like a Randall knifeI learned a few chords on the banjo as the key to life
I've got a secret I keep in my heartA secret that sure makes me smileAnd I've got a feeling deep down in my soulThat I haven't felt in a whileI've found somebody that really does love meAnd I know that she'll always stayI'm the luckiest guy in the world'Cause my heart feels this wayWe watch old movies and cry at the endingsAnd get lost in each other's eyesWe hold hands when we're walking andSpend all night talking and make love as the sun starts to riseShe's found somebody that really does love herAnd she knows that I'll always stayI'm the luckiest guy in the world'Cause her heart feels this wayWe share the same hopesWe dream the same dreamsOh lifelong companions I'd sayI'm the luckiest guy in the world'Cause our hearts feel this wayI'm the luckiest guy in the world'Cause our hearts feel this way

You're so close to tellin' me you're leavingPackin' up your things and leavin' townIf you can walk away the rest is easyOnce you cut the strings that tie you downJust look me in the eye and say it's overJust tell me you don't want me aroundOnce you say goodbye, it's gone foreverOnce you cut the strings that tie you downThere's no way I can picture me without youI still think of you in your wedding gownIf I have to give you up, may God be with youOnce you cut the strings that tie you down

Love sure is something no one can explainIt can bring you such joy, it can bring you painAnd with every emotion, love puts us throughThere's nothing you can say, when love finds youLove is the power that makes your heart beatIt can make you move mountains, make you drop to your kneesWhen it finally hits you, you won't know what to doThere's nothin' you can say, when love finds you[Chorus]Give it all you can give it, when your love comes aroundIf you put your heart in it, then it won't let you downYou'll find out it's true, baby, someday when love finds youAnd when you least expect it, it will finally come trueThere's nothing you can say when love finds you[Chorus]You'll find out it's true, baby, someday when love finds you
I've been cheated, been mistreated. When will I be Loved.  I've been put down, I've been pushed 'round. When will I be loved?  When I find a new Girl, that I want for mine. She always breaks my heart in 2, Happens every time.  I've been made blue,I've been lied to. When will I be Loved? When I find a new girl, that I want for mine. She always breaks my heart in 2. Happens every time.. I've been cheated, been mistreated.When will I be loved?  When will I be loved?When will I be loved?
The face of an angel; pretty eyes that shineI lie awake at night wishing you were mineI'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in townWhenever you come around[Chorus]I get weak in the knees; and I lose my breathOh I try to speak but the words won't comeI'm so scared to deathAnd when you smile the world turns upside downWhenever you come aroundI feel so helpless; I feel just like a kidWhat is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hidI wish I could tell you, bu the words can't be foundWhenever you come around[Chorus]And when you smile that smileThe whole world turns upside downWhenever you come aroundWhenever you come around
I've got two loves in my life nowA true love and one that's brand newI'm not really sure that I know howTo love one and tell one we're throughChorus:I can't sleep at night, I toss and turnI keep losing sight of lessons I've learnedI'm standing at the crossroads with just one concernWhich bridge to cross and which bridge to burnI knew this was wrong, I didn't listenCause a heart only knows what feels rightOh I need to reach a decisionAnd get on with the rest of my lifeRepeat Chorus

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones I used to know Where the treetops glisten, and children listen To hear sleigh bells in the snow I'm dreaming of a white Christmas With every Christmas card I write May your days be merry and bright And may all your Christmases be white I'm dreaming of a white Christmas With every Christmas card I write May your days be merry and bright And may all your Christmases be white  
Over the ground lies a mantel of white A heaven of diamonds Shine down through the night Two hearts are thrilling In spite of the chilling weather . . . Sleigh bells ring, are you listening In the lane, snow is glistening A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird Here to stay is a new bird He sings a love song, as we go along Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he is Parson Brown He'll say, are you married, we'll say, no man But you can do the job while you're in town Later on we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid the plans that we made Walking in a winter wonderland
