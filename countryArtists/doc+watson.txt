A-rovin' on a winter's nightAnd a-drinkin' good old wine,Thinkin' about that pretty little girl,That broke this heart of mine. She is just like a bud of rose,That blooms in the month of June.Or like some musical instrument,That's just been lately tuned.  Perhaps it's a trip to some foreign land, A trip to France or Spain, But if I should go ten thousand miles, I'm a-comin' home again.  And it's who's a-gonna shoe your poor little feet, Who's a-gonna glove your little hands? Who's a-gonna kiss your sweet little lips, Honey, who's a-gonna be your man?  I love you till the sea runs dry, And the rocks all melt in the sun. I love you till the day I die, Though you will never be my own.  A-rovin' on a winter's nightAnd a-drinkin' good old wine, Thinkin' about that pretty little girl, That broke this heart of mine.
Alberta let your hair hang lowI saw her first on an April morn'As she walked through the mist in a field of hayHer hair lit the world with its golden glowAnd the smile on her face burned my heart awayAlberta let your hair hang lowAlberta let your hair hang lowI'll give you more gold than your apron can holdIf you'll only let your hair hang lowI thought my golden time would lastBut the field of hay was soon cut downIn a short few weeks it all was pastAnd my golden girl just a painful songAlberta what's on your mindAlberta what's on your mindMy heart is so sad 'cause you treat me so badAlberta what's on your mindAlberta let your hair hang low
I asked my love to take a walk,Just a little way's with me.An' as we walked,Then we would talkAll about our wedding day.[Chorus]"Darlin', say that you'll be mine;In our home we'll happy be,Down beside where the waters flow,On the banks of the Ohio."I took her by her pretty white hand,I led her down the banks of sand,I plunged her inWhere she would drown,An' watched her as she floated down.[Chorus]Returnin' home between twelve and one,Thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done;I'd killed the girlI love, you see,Because she would not marry me.The very next day, at half past four,The sheriff walked right to my door;He says, "Young man,Don't try to run.You'll pay for this awful crime you've don."[Chorus]

John come home all in a wonder,Rattled at the door just like thunder."Who is that?" Mister Hendley cried,"It is my husband! You must hide!"She held the door till old man HendleyJumping and jerking went up the chimney.John come in, looked all around,But not a soul could be found. John sat down by the fireside weeping,Up the chimney he got to peeping.There he saw the poor old soulSittin' a-straddle of the pot-rack pole. John built on a rousing fireJust to suit his own desire.His wife called out with a free good will,"Don't do that, for the man you'll kill!" John reached up and down he fetched himLike a racoon dog he catched him.He blacked his eyes and then he did better:He kicked him out upon his setter. His wife she crawled in under the bed,He pulled her out by the hair of the head." When I'm gone, remember this!"And he kicked her where the kicking is best. The law came down and John went up,He didn't have the chance of a yellow pup,Sent him down to the old chain gangFor beating his wife, the dear little thing.When he got off, he went back to court,His wife she got him for non-support.John didn't worry and John didn't cryBut when he got close, he socked her in the eye. Took John back to the old town jailHis wife she come and paid his bail.Won't be long till he'll be loose --I could tell more about it but there ain't no use.
Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonderWhy it should be thus all the day long;While there are others living about us,Never molested, though in the wrong.When death has come and taken our loved ones,Leaving our home so lone and so drear,Then do we wonder why others prosper,Living so wicked year after year.Farther along we'll know all about it,Farther along we'll understand why;Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,We'll understand it all by and by.Sometimes I wonder why I must suffer,Go in the rain, the cold, and the snow,When there are many living in comfort,Giving no heed to all I can do."Faithful till death" saith our loving Master;A few more days to labor and wait;Then will our toiling seem to be nothing,When we shall pass the heavenly gate.Farther along we'll know all about it,Farther along we'll understand why;Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,We'll understand it all by and by.When we see Jesus coming in glory,When He comes from His home in the skythen we'll go with Him to heaven's bright cityWe'll understand it all by and by.Farther along we'll know all about it,Farther along we'll understand why;Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,We'll understand it all by and by.

My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelfSo it stood ninety years on the floorIt was taller by half than the old man himselfAnd it weight not a penny's weight moreIt was bought on the morn that my grandpa was bornAnd was always his treasure and prideBut it stopped short never to go againWhen the old man diedNinety years without slumbering (tic tac tic tac)His life's seconds numbering (tic tac tic tac)But it stopped short never to go againWhen the old man died.(break)At watching its pendulum swing to and froMany hours he had spent as a boyAs he grew into manhood the clock seemed to knowFor it sharaed everyu sorrow and joyAnd it struck tewntyfour as he entered the doorWith his beautiful and blushing brideBut it stopped short never to go againWhen the old man died(break)My grandfather said that of those he could hireNot a servant so faithful he'd foundFor it wasted no time and it had but one desireAt the close of each week to be woundYes it kept in its place but not a frown upon its faceAnd its hands never hung by its sideBut it stopped short never to go againWhen the old man died(break)Then it rang an alarm in the dead of the nightAn alarm that for years had been dumbAnd we knew that his spirit was pluming for flightThat his hour for departure had comeYes the clock kept the timeWith a soft and muffled chimeAs we stood there and watched by his sideBut it stopped short never to go againWhen the old man died
Well, I wish I was in London,Or some other seaport townI'd put my foot on a steamboatI'd sail the ocean 'round.While sailing 'round the ocean,While sailing 'round the seaI'd think of handsome MollyWherever she might be.Don't you remember, MollyYou gave me your right hand?You said whenever you'd marryI would be the man.But you broke your promiseGo with whom you pleaseMy poor heart is achingYou are at your ease.I went to church last SundayMolly came ridin' byI could tell her mind was changin'By the rovin' of her eye.I go down to the riverThough everyone's asleepI think of handsome MollyAn' I begin to weep.So I wish I was in London,Or some other seaport townI'd put my foot on a steamboatI'd sail the ocean 'round.

Went out one night for to make a little roundI met little Sadie and I shot her downWent back home and I got in my bedForty four pistol under my headWake up next morning 'bout a half past nineThe hacks and the buggies all standing in lineGents and the gamblers standing all roundTaking little Sadie to her burying groundThen I begin to think what a deed I'd doneI grabbed my hat and away I runMade a good run but a little too slowThey overtook me in JerichoI was standing on the corner, reading the billWhen up stepped the sheriff from ThomasvilleHe said, young man, ain't your name Brown?Remember the night you shot Sadie down?I said, yes, sir, my name is LeeI murdered little Sadie in the first degreeAnd first degree and the second degreeIf you got any papers, won't you read 'em to me?They took me downtown and dressed me in blackPut me on the train and started me backThey crammed me back in that Thomasville jailAnd I had no money for to go my bailThat judge and the jury, they took their standThe judge had the papers in his right handForty one days and forty one nightsForty one years to wear the ball and the stripes
My parents raised me tenderly,They had no child but me.My mind being placed on rambling,With them I couldn't agreeJust to leave my aged parentsAnd them no more to see.There was a wealthy gentlemanWho lived there very near by.He had a beautiful daughter,On her I cast an eye.She was so tall and slender,So pretty and so fair.There never was a girl in this whole wide worldWith her I could compare.I asked her if it differedIf I crossed over the plain.She said, "It makes no differenceIf you never return again."We too shook hands and parted,And I left my girl behind.I started out in this wide worldStrange faces for to see.I met little Maggie WalkerAnd she fell in love with me.Her pockets all lined with greenbackAnd her labor I'll grow old,Now if you'll consent to marry meI'll say I'll roam no more.I traveled out one morning,To the salt works I were bound.And when I reached the salt worksI viewed the city all around.Work and money were plentifulAnd the girls all kind to me.But the only object to my heartWas a girl in Tennessee.I traveled out one morningDown on the market square.The mail train being on arrival,I met the carrier there.He handed me a letter,So's I could understandThat the girl I left in TennesseeHad married another man.I drove on down a little furtherAnd found that it was true.I turned my horse and buggy aroundBut I didn't know what to do.I turned all around and about there --Bad company I'll resign;I'll drive all about from town to townFor the girl I left behind.

Oh, listen to my story, I'll tell you no lies,How John Lewis did murder poor little Omie Wise.He told her to meet him at Adams's Springs.He promised her money and other fine things.So, fool-like she met him at Adams's Springs.No money he brought her nor other fine things."Go with me, little Omie, and away we will go.We'll go and get married and no one will know."She climbed up behind him and away they did go,But off to the river where deep waters flow."John Lewis, John Lewis, will you tell me your mind?Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?""Little Omie, little Omie, I'll tell you my mind.My mind is to drown you and leave you behind.""Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life,I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife."He kissed her and hugged her and turned her around,Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown.He got on his pony and away he did ride,As the screams of little Omie went down by his side.T'was on a Thursday morning, the rain was pouring down,When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found.Two boys went a-fishin' one fine summer day,And saw little Omie's body go floating away.They threw their net around her and drew her to the bank.Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank.Then sent for John Lewis to come to that place --And brought her out before him so that he might see her face.He made no confession but they carried him to jail,No friends or relations would go on his bail.
Step up, buddies, and listen to my songI'll sing it to you right, but you may sing it wrong,All about a man named Otto Wood,I can't tell you all, but I wish I could.He walked in a pawn shop a rainy day,And with the clerk he had a quarrel, they say.Pulled out his pistol and he struck him a blow,And this is the way the story goes.They spread the news as fast as they could,The sheriff served a warrant on Otto Wood.The jury said murder in the second degree,And the judge passed the sentence to the penitentiary.[Chorus]Otto, why didn't you run?Otto's done dead and gone.Otto Wood, why didn't you runWhen the sheriff pulled out his 44 gun?They put him in the pen, but it done no good,It wouldn't hold the man they call Otto Wood.It wasn't very long till he slipped outside,Drawed a gun on the guard, said, "Take me for a ride."Second time they caught him was away out west,In the holdup game, he got shot through the breast.They brought him back and when he got well,They locked him down in a dungeon cell.He was a man they could not run,He always carried a 44 gun.He loved the women and he hated the law,And he just wouldn't take nobody's jaw.He rambled out west and he rambled all around,He met the sheriff in a southern town.And the sheriff says, "Otto, step this way,'Cause I've been expecting you every day."He pulled out his gun and then he said,"If you make a crooked move, you both fall dead.Crank up your car and take me out of town,"And a few minutes later, he was graveyard bound.
I've got to tell you I've been rackin' my brainHopin' to find a way outI've had enough of this continual rainChanges are comin', no doubt (Chorus:)It's been a too long timeWith no peace of mindAnd I'm ready for the timesTo get better You seem to want from me what I cannot giveI feel so lonesome at timesI have a dream that I wish I could liveIt's burnin' holes in my mind (Repeat chorus) Na, na, na... (Repeat chorus)

Along about eighteen twenty-five,I left Tennessee very much alive.I never would have got through the Arkansas mudIf I hadn't been a-ridin' on the Tennessee Stud.I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa,And one of her brothers was a bad outlaw.I sent her a letter by my Uncle Bud,And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud.  The Tennessee Stud was long and lean,The color of the sun, and his eyes were green.He had the nerve and he had the blood,And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud.One day I was riding in a beautiful landI run smack into an Indian bandThey jumped their nags with a whoop and a yellAnd away we rode like a bat out of hell.I circled their camp for a time or two,Just to show what a Tennessee horse can do.The redskin boys couldn't get my blood,'Cause I was a-riding on the Tennessee Stud. We drifted on down into no man's land,We crossed that river called the Rio Grande.I raced my horse with the Spaniard's foal'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold. Me and a gambler, we couldn't agree,We got in a fight over Tennessee.We jerked our guns, and he fell with a thud,And I got away on the Tennessee Stud. I got just as lonesome as a man can be,Dreamin' of my girl in Tennessee.The Tennessee Stud's green eyes turned blue'Cause he was a-dreamin' of a sweetheart, too, We loped right back across Arkansas;I whupped her brother and I whupped her pa.I found that girl with the golden hair,And she was a-riding on the Tennessee Mare. Stirrup to stirrup and side by side,We crossed the mountains and the valleys wide.We came to Big Muddy, then we forded the floodOn the Tennessee Mare and the Tennessee Stud. A pretty little baby on the cabin floor,A little horse colt playing 'round the door,I love that girl with the golden hair,And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare.
THAT OLD WOODEN ROCKER There it stands by the fire with it's back to the wallThat old wooden rocker, so stately and tallWith naught to disturb it but dusting of broomAnd no one to use it in that parlor room ChorusAs she sat by the fire, she would rock, rock, rockAnd she heard but the tick of the old grand clockEighty years has she sat in that chair, prim and tallThat old wooden rocker that stands by the wall How well I still remember in days that are gone byHow we stood by that rocker, my sister and IAnd we listened to the stories that grandma would tellAs she sat in the rocker that we all loved so well If the chair could but speak, oh the tales it would tellHow my poor aged grandpa, in his battle, fellBeneath the stars and the stripes, he fought bravely and trueHe cherished his freedom beneath the red white and blue Chorus Now grandma is dead, all the stories are doneAll the children have followed her, yes one by oneThey have all gone to meet her in the sweet by and byAnd all that is left is my sister and I Chorus

Oh, listen today to the story I tell,It's sadned with tear dimmed eyes,Of a dreadful cyclone that came this way,And blew our schoolhouse away.  Rye Cove, Rye CoveThe place of my childhood and home,Where in life's early morn I once loved to roam,But now it's so silent and lone.  When the great storm appeared it darkened the air,And the lightning flashed over the sky,Then the children all cried, "Don't take us away,But spare us to go back home."  Rye Cove, Rye CoveThe place of my childhood and home,Where in life's early morn I once loved to roam,But now it's so silent and lone.  Oh the mothers so sad and fathers the same,They came to this horrible scene,Then searching and crying each found their own child,Dying on a pillow of stone.  Lord give us a home far beyond the blue skies,Where storms and cyclones are unknown,And there will we stand and gladly clasp hands,With our children in their heavenly home. Rye Cove, Rye CoveThe place of my childhood and home,Where in life's early morn I once loved to roam,But now it's so silent and lone.
A miner was leaving his home for his workWhen he heard his little child scream.He went to the side of the little girl's bed;She said, "Daddy, I've had such a dream!""Please, daddy, don't go to the mines today,For dreams have so often come true.My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,For I never could live without you."Then smiling and stroking the little girl's face,He was turning away from her side.But she threw her small arms around daddy's neck;She gave him a kiss and then cried:"Oh, I dreamed that the mines were all flaming with fire,And the men all fought for their lives.Just then the scene changed, and the mouth of the minesWas covered with sweethearts and wives.""Oh, daddy, don't go to the mines today,For dreams have so often come true.My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,For I never could live without you.""Go down to the village and tell your dear friendsThat as sure as the bright stars do shine,There is something that's going to happen today;Please, daddy, don't go to the mines.""Oh, daddy, don't work in the mines today,For dreams have so often come true.My daddy, my daddy, please don't go away,For I never could live without you."
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim layAnd pensively stood by his tomb,When in a low whisper I heard something say,"How sweetly I sleep here alone.The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar,And gathering storms may arise,But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul.The tears are all wiped from my eyes.The cause of my Master compelled me from home,No kindred or relative nigh.I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,My soul flew to mansions on high.Go tell my companion and children most dearTo weep not for me now I'm gone.The same hand that led me through scenes most severeHas kindly assisted me home."
