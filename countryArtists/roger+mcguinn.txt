Smoky autumn night, Stars up in the sky,I see the sailin' boats Across the bay go by.Eucalyptus trees hang above the streetAnd then I turn my head, For you're approachin' me.Moonlight on the water, Fisherman's daughter, Floatin' in to my roomWith a golden loom.First we wash our feet Near the immortal shrineAnd then our shadows meet And then we drink the wine.I see the hungry clouds up above your faceAnd then the tears roll down, What a bitter taste.And then you drift away On a summer's day where The wildflowers bloom With your golden loom.I walk across the bridge In the dismal lightWhere all the cars are stripped Between the gates of night.I see the trembling lion With the lotus flower tailAnd then I kiss your lips As I lift your veil.But you're gone and then All I seem to recall Is the smell of perfumeAnd your golden loom.

Darkness at the break of noonShadows even the silver spoonThe handmade blade, the child's balloonEclipses both the sun and moonTo understand you know too soonThere is no sense in trying.Pointed threats, they bluff with scornSuicide remarks are tornFrom the fool's gold mouthpieceThe hollow horn plays wasted wordsProves to warnThat he not busy being bornIs busy dying.Temptation's page flies out the doorYou follow, find yourself at warWatch waterfalls of pity roarYou feel to moan but unlike beforeYou discoverThat you'd just beOne more person crying.So don't fear if you hearA foreign sound to your earIt's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.As some warn victory, some downfallPrivate reasons great or smallCan be seen in the eyes of those that callTo make all that should be killed to crawlWhile others say don't hate nothing at allExcept hatred.Disillusioned words like bullets barkAs human gods aim for their markMade everything from toy guns that sparkTo flesh-colored Christs that glow in the darkIt's easy to see without looking too farThat not muchIs really sacred.While preachers preach of evil fatesTeachers teach that knowledge waitsCan lead to hundred-dollar platesGoodness hides behind its gatesBut even the president of the United StatesSometimes must haveTo stand naked.An' though the rules of the road have been lodgedIt's only people's games that you got to dodgeAnd it's alright, Ma, I can make it.Advertising signs that con youInto thinking you're the oneThat can do what's never been doneThat can win what's never been wonMeantime life outside goes onAll around you.You lose yourself, you reappearYou suddenly find you got nothing to fearAlone you stand with nobody nearWhen a trembling distant voice, unclearStartles your sleeping ears to hearThat somebody thinksThey really found you.A question in your nerves is litYet you know there is no answer fit to satisfyInsure you not to quitTo keep it in your mind and not fergitThat it is not he or she or them or itThat you belong to.Although the masters make the rulesFor the wise men and the foolsI got nothing, Ma, to live up to.For them that must obey authorityThat they do not respect in any degreeWho despise their jobs, their destiniesSpeak jealously of them that are freeCultivate their flowers to beNothing more than somethingThey invest in.While some on principles baptizedTo strict party platform tiesSocial clubs in drag disguiseOutsiders they can freely criticizeTell nothing except who to idolizeAnd then say God bless him.While one who sings with his tongue on fireGargles in the rat race choirBent out of shape from society's pliersCares not to come up any higherBut rather get you down in the holeThat he's in.But I mean no harm nor put faultOn anyone that lives in a vaultBut it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.Old lady judges watch people in pairsLimited in sex, they dareTo push fake morals, insult and stareWhile money doesn't talk, it swearsObscenity, who really caresPropaganda, all is phony.While them that defend what they cannot seeWith a killer's pride, securityIt blows the minds most bitterlyFor them that think death's honestyWon't fall upon them naturallyLife sometimesMust get lonely.My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyardsFalse gods, I scuffAt pettiness which plays so roughWalk upside-down inside handcuffsKick my legs to crash it offSay okay, I have had enoughWhat else can you show me?And if my thought-dreams could be seenThey'd probably put my head in a guillotineBut it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.
A simple thing, another springand you were there to share my empty bedBut now I see you played with meI can't believe I heard the words you saidIt's goneNow you're crying shame, you curse my nameFor askin' you to go you throw me to the wolvesBut wasn't it clear the end was here?And we were bein' sentimental foolsIt's goneRemember that day in the sun, The lake reflecting goldWalk behind the waterfall, I hold youAnd what would we have doneIf the future could be told?The sun was goin' down and it was coldIt was coldNothin's free for you or meI know about the pain, it's mainly in your headBut at the start it was your heartThe night you came to share my empty bedIt's gone

L.A.'s asleep - you roll up your windowThe night air is cold - the freeway is clear.In a green Gucci bag - are you prized possessionsThe jewels of your mind - to hold back the fear. And when Monday comes round - there's a high lonesome soundAnd she follows you down for the kill.And a while blinding light - makes it all seem so rightAnd you feel like the king of the hill. The driveway is long - your princess is lovelyYour servants all wait - for your knock on the door.How many years - will you crawl through this castleSo satisfied - and still wanting more.And when Monday comes... The guests have arrived - with all the right facesBut you miss the ball - in that room down the hall.It's sunrise again - the driveway is emptyThe crystal is cracked - there's blood on the wall.And when Monday comes round...

The Lord he loves a rolling stoneHe leads around all the danger zonesAnd helps get on to where he's goingHe don't ask for very muchA dream or two will always doIn a crises he makes sacrificesThe man who wears the freedom walkHe lets his eyes do all the talkAnd conversation is his prize possessionOn the road the open road he stops to flag a dieselA pre war mack offered him a rideAnd stone climbed into the cabinThat old bucket of bolts sure was a gasShe moaned and groaned like An old truck do in south bend IndianaStone got out at the crossroadsSaid his last goodbyeStarted walking down a new road
It was a date nightAll the Friday night girls are good lookingWas a late nightAll the after hours spots are still cooking And you don't have to go very farTo get a standing ovation at the barI see you're dressed to kill if you need to you willYou've done it before it's not hard Stopping trafficAnd keeping the night aliveYou can't tell meIt's something that you never tried You'd showJust when I was tryin' to forget youPut on a good showWhen your Samurai style would let you I know you're just at that ageWhen you're going through men like a stageYou tore through me like I was no mysteryYou read me then ripped out the page Stopping traffic and keeping the night aliveYou can't tell me it's something that you never triedYou swore when you left you hadn't but I know you lied (Oooh)Stopping traffic and keeping the night alive You swore when you left you hadn't but I know you lied (Oooh)Stopping traffic and keeping the night alive

The glaciers near the polar campHave all begun to meltTemperatures are on the riseFar from the southern beltWater levels shifting tidesOn every changing landRain forests in the AmazonHave vanished from our handAnd the trees are all goneYeah you know it's all wrongAnd the trees are all goneThe people want to eat todayAnd so they clear the landGlobal warming is a conceptThey can't understandBut all the politcians nowThey have no excuseThey just hide behind their powerAnd keep us from the truthMan has tried his suicideWith bigotry and hateBut in the end he'll kill himselfWith nothing but his wasteWhat will finally happen whenThe farm lands turn to dustWhen only rich receive the foodAnd nothing's left for usBut all the politcians nowThey have no excuseThey just hide behind their powerAnd keep us from the truth
The water is wide I can not cross over And neither have I wings to fly Build me a boat that can carry two And both shall roam my love and I A ship there is and she sails the sea Sailing as deep as deep can beBut not so deep as the love I am in I know not how I sink or swim I leaned my back against some young oak  Thinking that he was a trusty tree But first he bent and then he broke And thus did my false love and me The water is wide I can not cross over And neither have I wings to fly Build me a boat that can carry two And both shall roam my love and I
The planet was molded from great clouds of dustThen molten eruptions would burst through the crustA new sun was shining and covered the earthThe heavens all knowing acknowledged the birthThe seas were forming before life beganIt would take a long time to crawl on the landThe rivers were waiting for the arrivalThe lowlands provided a place of survivalMan cam from the mud and the ooze and the slimeAn integral part of a master designHe gazed at the stars and the moon in the skySome knew they were going and some wondered whyMan made a beginning and went to the moonA few fellow creatures predicted earth's doomHis colonisation out into space is more than A great leap for the whole human raceSome dream of a journey to the neighboring starAnd some will not listen, they say it's too farHe'll create a machine and launch it somedayTo reach Alpha Centauri four light years awayThen evolve to the stars of our galaxyAnd write a new chapter of man's destinyMan came from the mude and the ooze and the slimeAn integral part of a master design
Love was never good to himAll his days were spent in shadowsStanding near the carouselWatching lovers spin around, togetherNo one could remember whyNo one heard his lonely storyWalking in the crowded streetsPast the couples holding hands, togetherTogetherOh the music in the wordAnd the feeling he could feelThe rush of rivers flowingAnd the touch of something realTogetherTogetherDreaming of a tiny lightIn the distance of the nightTogetherKeeping secrets to himselfSmiling at the conveersationDinner with an old-time friendLook at all the people there, togetherAnd then, and then he met herAnd suddenly his life was upside downA summer party by the seaAnd all the time the fear that sheWould make him play the clownBut oh how warm the look she gaveAnd oh how sweet the songHe met her and his heart was swept alongNothing lives that cannot dieNo onoe loves except foreverSo he promised he would tryAnd they started out, together
Everythin' went from bad to worse, Money never changed a thing,Death kept followin', trackin' us down, At least I heard your bluebird sing.Now somebody's got to show their hand, Time is an enemy,I know you're long gone,I guess it must be up to me.If I'd thought about it I never would've done it, I guess I would've let it slide,If I'd lived my life By what others were thinkin', The heart inside me would've died.I was just too stubborn To ever be governed By enforced insanity,Someone had to reach For the risin' star,I guess it was up to me.Oh, the Union Central is pullin' out And the orchids are in bloom,I've only got me One good shirt left And it smells of stale perfume.In fourteen months I've only smiled once And I didn't do it consciously,Somebody's got to find your trail,I guess it must be up to me.It was like a revelation When you betrayed me with your touch,I'd just about convinced myself That nothin' had changed that much.The old Rounder in the iron mask Slipped me the master key,Somebody had to unlock your heart,He said it was up to me.Well, I watched you slowly disappear Down into the officers' club,I would've followed you in the door But I didn't have a ticket stub.So I waited all night 'Til the break of day, Hopin' one of us could get free,When the dawn came over the river bridge,I knew it was up to me.Oh, the only decent thing I did When I worked as a postal clerkWas to haul your picture down off the wall Near the cage where I used to work.Was I a fool or not To try to protect your identity?You looked a little Burned out, my friend,I thought it might be up to me.Well, I met somebody face to face And I had to remove my hat,She's everything I need and love But I can't be swayed by that.It frightens me, The awful truth of How sweet life can be,But she ain't a-gonna make me move,I guess it must be up to me.We heard the Sermon on the Mount And I knew it was too complex,It didn't amount to anything more Than what the broken glass reflects.When you bite off more Than you can chew You pay the penalty,Somebody's got to tell the tale,I guess it must be up to me.Well, Dupree came in pimpin' tonight To the Thunderbird Cafe,Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.Well, I just can't rest Without you, love, I need your company,But you ain't a-gonna cross the line,I guess it must be up to me.There's a note left in the bottle, You can give it to Estelle,She's the one You been wond'rin' about, But there's really Nothin' much to tell.We both heard voices for a while, Now the rest is history,Somebody's got to cry some tears,I guess it must be up to me.So go on, boys, and play your hands, Life is a pantomime,The ringleaders From the county seat Say you don't have all that much time.And the girl with me Behind the shades, She ain't my property,One of us has got to hit the road,I guess it must be up to me.And if we never meet again, Baby, remember me,How my lone guitar Played sweet for you That old-time melody.And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free,No one else could play that tune,You know it was up to me.
Just look at youWhat I put you throughMakin' my movesTravelin' in a bandRock'n Roll yearsLaughter and tearsYou were sharin' my fearsOn the lonely one night standsWould youLearnin' to flyJust gettin' byGirl, you and IMore than friendsStories we toldDreams that we soldSearchin' for goldAt the rainbows endWould youYou and meSweet memoriesLove at its bestGirl, we put it through the testDo you believeWe can do it all over againWould you
Well I got a crow I want to pick with youJust like before when the feathers flewYou're runnin' wild kickin' up your heelsLeavin' me home with a handful of billsIt's too late to leave you and I know it's trueThere ain't no livin' with you so what'll I doI'm goin' honky tonkin' get as tight as I canAnd maybe by then you'll appreciate a good manWell I don't know but I've heard sayEvery little dog's gonna have his dayYou better listen to me don't you dare forgetCause you ain't but just a little bitty puppy yetTell me why baby why babyWhy baby why you make meCry baby cry babyCry baby cryI can't live without you Till the day that I dieTell me why baby why babyWhy baby whyI caught you honky tonkin' with my best friendThe thing to do was leave you way back thenIt's too late to leave you but I still get soreWhen ya come home a feelin' for the knob on the door
There was no one else but youFrom the moment that we metFoolish dreams were coming trueIt's a time I can't forgetBe my wife for evermoreBe my girl and comfort mePut the lock upon the doorSmile and throw away the keyWithout you without youI'm without youWith the movement of your headYou could tell me what was wrongWas it something that I saidWas my love for you too strongIf I know this thing I didThat was always in your wayI could make you do my biddingI could make you want to stayNow I'm here without a friendCup of coffee in my handWalk the floor without an endStaring at your wedding bandWithout you without youI'm without you
Now that you're goneIt's no fun without youI just think of things we used to doLike watching the sunsetOver the seaAnd sailing the islandsSo happy and freeNow that you're goneI have to face livingWithout your eyes to see throughShadows are fallingBefore all my stepsI can't see the path throughThe tears that I've weptWithout your loveThe days are so longAnd I can't believe you're goneI'm without your loveNow that you're goneWithout your loveNow that you're goneNow that you're goneI need help acceptingThis mercy so severeMornings I wake upAnd reach out for youThen I rememberBut what can I doWithout your loveThe days are so longAnd I can't believe you're gone
I suppose you're entitled to knowWhy I'm making contactWith acqaintances scattered All over the landI'd promise you now and again That I'd honor the contractIf it hadn't crumbled away in my handWell we broke that vow independently nowBut I don't know why you absolutely denyYou bowed downYou bowed downWhen you first looked away I might say it was really a kindnessI must have hurt to see how dreams sourNow they say that justice and love Are the next things to blindnessWell you're getting plenty Of both of them nowAnd so you parade where Appointments are madeAnd never meant to be kept Unless you acceptYou'll value the burnt amber of falling leavesAnd you'll long to delayYou feel their breath as they whisperIt won't hurt you now to betrayIf you just bow downAnd now every time that we meet On the edge of hysteriaYou're helping them sell off Some new party lineI remember a time when you Would have seemed so superiorNow you say "will you please Meet this good friend of mine"So you're in demand as long As you kiss their handBut all the applause Is for their name not yours
She got rubies on her pillowShe got sapphires on the head of her bedShe got emeralds on her finger tipsShe got diamonds in her hairsShe got jasper on her curtainsShe got chrysolite on her ceilingShe got topaz on the soles of her shoesAnd it sparkles as she's leavingI see her standing in the candlelight come a come a to me tonightYour love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fineYour love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mineShe got amethyst in her earingsShe got platinum on the tip of her toesShe got sterling in her dresser drawersShe got yellow gold on the helms of her clothesI see her standing in the candlelight come a come a to me tonightYour love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fineYour love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mineSo many facets of your love it's so refinedTake me forever to mine it out  but I don't mindI think about her and I call her nameHer eyes reflecting in the window paneI see her standing in the candlelight come a come a to me tonightYour love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fineYour love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mineYour love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fineYour love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mineYour love is the sweetest thing your love makes me feel so fineYour love is a shimmering light your love is a gold mine
