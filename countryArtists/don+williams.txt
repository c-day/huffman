Break us down by our elements and you might think he failedWe're not copper for one penny or even iron for one nailAnd a dollar would be plenty to buy twenty of usUntil true love is added to these handfuls of dustHandful of dust, handful of dustSums up the richest and poorest of usTrue love makes priceless the worthlessWhenever it's added to a handful of dustHowever small though our worth may be when shared between two heartsIs even more than it would ever be, measured on its own apartAnd our half what it could be is now twice what it wasWhen true love is added to these handfuls of dustHandful of dust, handful of dustSums up the richest, poorest of usTrue love makes priceless the worthlessWhenever it's added to a handful of dustHandful of dust, handful of dustSums up the richest, poorest of usTrue love makes priceless the worthlessWhenever it's added to a handful of dust
I've never had a face you'd noticeThe world never took much notice of meI've never been good at conversationI was too busy tripping on my own feetI've never had grand illusionsLove was always for someone elseBut in a world so few surprisesThere's still a few surprises leftAin't it amazing that miracles happen?Ain't it amazing, you can still find your dream?Ain't it amazing, it all comes trueWhen someone like you can happen to someone like me?So hold me now so warm beside youLet me stay forever nearSometimes I think I'm only dreamingBut I wake up, you're still here
I go to places we like to goI do the things we like to doFamiliar faces we both knowAll I'm missing is youDon't ask me how I'm getting along'Cause there's really nothing newEverything's about the same since you've goneAll I'm missing is youThe same ol'e memories are just as strongSame ol'e dreams, don't come trueThat same ol'e feeling goes on and onAll I'm missing is you
I've held it all inwardLord knows I've triedIt's an awful awakenin'In a country boy's lifeWhen you look in the mirrorIn total surpriseAt the hair on your shouldersAnd the age in your eyes.[Chorus]Amanda light of my lifeFate should have made you a gentle man's wifeAmanda light of my lifeFate should have made you a gentle man's wife.Well the measure of peopleDon't understandThe pleasures of lifeIn a hillbilly bandI got my first guitarWhen I was fourteenNow I'm crowding thirtyAnd still wearin' jeans.[Chorus]
Oh it's late I know I should be leavingWe've both got someone waiting we'll have to goAnd it's so strange to think that I just met youI almost wish I'd met you long agoIn your eyes I see a certain look and that same look must be in mineAnd who knows just what we might have been another place another timeI'll admit in time that I'll forget youCause the truth is I still love her after allBut even though we knew it couldn't happenFor a moment we felt something oh so strongAnd in your eyesAnd who knows just what we might have been another place another time
Atta way to go you finally broke it offAtta way to go we can't even talk or cryOr even wonder why that a way to goDidn't you believe me when I loved youI guess you thought we were playing gamesAll this time I tried to think I've known youI guess I really only knew your nameAtta way to go you finally broke it offAtta way to go we can't even talk or cryOr even wonder why that a way to goI thought you knew I lived my life just for youThere was just no price to big to payAnd even though I know I still live for youThe feeling's that you show won't let me stay
Back in my younger days I used to go all night longNow I just stay at home and everything is all rightBack when I first met you I used to live in a hazeBut that was so long ago back in my younger daysI would do anything just to stumble and foolIt's a wonder I'm standing here I've broken so many rulesNow I dance with you every night and still I'm amazedYour love made a man of me back in my younger daysOh it doesn't seem that long agoYou you make it feel like the first time we made loveAnd I ain't even gettin' enough well well wellAs I go through the photographs I laugh and turn the pageIt's the ballad of me and you from such an innocent ageTalk about a dream come true we reinvented the phraseIt's better than it used to be back in my younger daysBack in my younger days back in my younger daysIt's better than it used to be back in my younger days

Well he spent that summer walkin' door to doorWith a can of gas and an ol' lawn mowerThat's a sure fire way to make a buck when you're fourteenWell he made a buck with no luck at allThen he spotted a place where the weeds were tallWith a young girl sitting on the front porch eating ice creamDeep in the pocket of his grass stained jeansWas some caramel corn and a plastic ringLeftover from the week beforeMomma didn't wash them, thank the LordJust like a Cracker Jack DiamondYou never know when you're gonna find oneThey found love from that day onThe hand of fate put them togetherTheir hearts will stay forever youngLike a Cracker Jack DiamondWell it's been five years since he gave her his prizeNow the sparkle's gone, but not in their eyesAnd he's wanting to tell her what's been on his mind latelyHe said, "Girl, I ain't rich but I've been saving upA little ever day 'til I had enough"Before he could finished she said, "You know I will, baby"Deep in the pocket of his holy jeansWas money for the preacher and a diamond ringHe took her back to that old front porchSlipped it on her finger and he thank the LordJust like a Cracker Jack DiamondYou never know when you're gonna find oneThey found love from that day onThe hand of fate put them togetherTheir hearts will stay forever youngLike a Cracker Jack DiamondNow once a year she takes it out but it won't fit her handBut she wears it in her heartBecause that's where it all beganJust like a Cracker Jack DiamondYou never know when you're gonna find oneThey found love from that day onThe hand of fate put them togetherTheir hearts will stay forever youngLike a Cracker Jack Diamond

Sitting in the barroom, ordering another beerShe stepped up on the stage, but nobody wanted to hearAnd every word she sang was sweet music to my earsElise, Elise, I believe every word you sayElise, Elise, I believe every word you sayIt don't matter if the world don't listenDon't you pay no heedElise, Elise, come and sing your song with meI sat there at the bar, she sang the blues all nightSinging straight from the heart, living every lineI wanna tell you, girl, you touched this heart of mineElise, Elise, I believe every word you sayElise, Elise, I believe every word you sayEnd of the night, well, they turned the lights down lowWhile the band packed up, she was standing there ready to goI walked up and said, "Hey, I just want to let you know"Elise, Elise, I believe every word you sayElise, Elise, I believe every word you sayIt don't matter if the world don't listenDon't you pay no heedElise, Elise, come and sing your song with meElise, Elise, come and sing your song with me
The night was dark, rain falling down.Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.Traced her footsteps down to the shore;Afraid she's gone forever more.I looked at the sea and it seemed to say:I took your baby from you, away.I heard a voice crying in the deep:Come join me baby, in my endless sleep.Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?Why did I leave her alone tonight?That's why her footsteps ran into the sea;That's why my baby is gone from me.I looked at the sea and it seemed to say:I took your baby from you, away.I heard a voice crying in the deep:Come join me baby, in my endless sleep.Ran in the water, heart full of fear.There in the breakers, I saw her near.Reached for my baby, held her to me.Stole her back from the endless sleep.I looked at the sea and it seemed to say:You took your baby from me, away.My heart cried out, she's mine to keep.I saved my baby from that endless sleep.
SPECIALLY YOUWRITER RICK BERESFORDCOPYRIGHT 1981I see the rainbow in your eyes, I see the colors pass me byI sure like the things my eyes can do, especially when they see youI hear the music of this day, I sure like the songs this world can playBut most of all I like your tune, when you whisper I love youMy senses don't like, I get a definite highWhen you're near I feel clear off the groundReach for my arms, and I will give you the starsThere is nothing that is holding us downI touch the textures of this earth,I felt for the good and I felt for the worseBut I never knew what a touch could do until I was touched by you
No one could love me the way that you love me but is it a matter of timeBut each time you hold me the way that you hold me time never crosses my mindWe all took chances sometimes too many so I'll take some chances myself'Cause you're an expert at everything I never thought ofAnd real good at everything elseYou give me kisses for no special reason no special reason's enoughYou never wait till the party's all over to show me I'm the one you loveYou never do me the way that they did me'Cause look what you've done with what was leftYou're an expert at everything I never thought ofAnd real good at everything elseYou give me kisses for no special reason...
Fair weather friends, fair weather sailors,Will leave you stranded on life's shore.One good friend who truly loves youIs worth the pain your heart endures.We never know which way the wind will blow,Nor when or where the next turmoil will be.But He's a solid rock when troubles grow,And He's holding out a saving hand for me.He'll be a refuge in the storm;He'll be a beacon in the night;In the chilly winds of doubt He'll keep you warm;When you can't find your way He'll be your light
I should take my time, I know, take it easy, take it slowEvery heartache needs to mend, before you love againSo I hold on for awhile and try to keep this old heart freeAnd then I look across a room and someone smiles at me[Chorus]Oh and heaven help me here I go againBefore I've even had the time for this old heart to mendOh I just get over one heartache and thenHere I go, like a fool, falling againPeople tell me take your time, wait awhile and clear your mindGive yourself some time to heal, If you fall be sure it's realBut it seems that every time, I'm almost on my feetSomeone makes me say hello, someone on the street[Chorus]
Falling In Love AgainLove be gentle, love be kindAs I give this heart of mineTo a new love I hope will never endIt seems like only yesterdayLove was here and went awayOut of love again but now I'm falling in[Chorus:]Fallin' in love againI'd fallen out but there's no doubtI'm fallin' in, love againI know that love won't always lastWhen you fall in love to fastI should know betterBut here I go againLove be strong, love be trueFor what else can I doLove is calling and I know I'm fallin' in[Chorus:]Fallin' in love againI'd fallen out but there's no doubtI'm fallin' in, love againChorus:Fallin' in love againI'd fallen out but there's no doubtI'm fallin' in, love again...
I don't believe in superstars,Organic food and foreign cars.I don't believe the price of gold;The certainty of growing old.That right is right and left is wrong,That north and south can't get along.That east is east and west is west.And being first is always best.But I believe in love.I believe in babies.I believe in Mom and Dad.And I believe in you.Well, I don't believe that heaven waits,For only those who congregate.I like to think of God as love:He's down below, He's up above.He's watching people everywhere.He knows who does and doesn't care.And I'm an ordinary man,Sometimes I wonder who I am.But I believe in love.I believe in music.I believe in magic.And I believe in you.Well, I know with all my certainty, What's going on with you and me, Is a good thing.It's true, I believe in you. I don't believe virginity,Is as common as it used to be. In working days and sleeping nights,That black is black and white is white. That Superman and Robin Hood,Are still alive in Hollywood.That gasoline's in short supply,The rising cost of getting by.But I believe in love.I believe in old folks. I believe in children.I believe in you.But I believe in love.I believe in babies.I believe in Mom and Dad.And I believe in you.

What a time to turn your back on someoneWhat a day to be without a friendWhat a shame when no-one seems to botherWho will offer shelter to candles in the windAnd it follows we are only helpless childrenEver changing like sunlight through the treesIt's a long road we must cling to one anotherHelp yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to beAnd it's said that life is like a ladderJust a dream we're reaching for the starsCan't you see how little really mattersWe are only searching for what we really areAnd it follows we are only helpless childrenEver changing like sunlight through the treesIt's a long road we must cling to one anotherHelp yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to beIt's a long road we must cling to one anotherHelp yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to be

I remember how we struggled when we first started outShe recalls, we had it all, not what we did withoutI think back on those hard times, she remembers only loveWell, who am I to say, that's not exactly how it was?That's how she remembers it, she was the lucky oneJust take a look at both of us and you tell me who wonIf she thinks I hung the stars, if that's what she believesThen who am I to tamper with her perfect memory?You ought to hear her tell the kids how mom and daddy metIt always amazes me, the things that she forgetsSomehow she gets it turned around but it's still my favorite partHow mommy looked in daddy?s eyes and I stole away her heartThat's how she remembers it, she was the lucky oneJust take a look at both of us and you tell me who wonIf she thinks I hung the stars, if that's what she believesThen who am I to tamper with her perfect memory?If I made her dreams come true as far as she can seeWho am I to tamper with her perfect memory?

I don't think much about her no moreSeldom if ever does she cross my mindYesterdays gone, it's better forgottenLike the poison red berries to die, on the vineThis morning at dawn Lord I pulled into townHad some coffee and talked with some old friends of mineLaughing at the good times they rememberedThen I remembered a timeLord I can still see the bright lights back in DallasAs yesterday moves like a dream through my mindI didn't suppose that I'd ever forget herAnd you know it took such a long timeBut I don't think much about her no moreSeldom if ever does she cross my mindYesterdays gone, Lord it's better forgottenLike the poison red berries that cling, to the mind

Another twenty miles and I'm halfway there,Another twenty miles and I'm running scaredIt's a beautiful night and I should be thereI know you are tired of waitingAnd I know you are tired of hesitatingIf love gets there before I do,Darling don't you take it.If love gets there before I do,Darling don' t you do it, no don't you do itI know you're hearing line from those other guysTrying to wear you down under starry skyBut you know that I want you to just hold onI know you are tired of waitingAnd I know you are tired of hesitatingIf love gets there before I do,Darling don't you take it.If love gets there before I do,Darling don' t you do it, no don't you do it
It may not make me tremble,The soft touch of her handBut she won't break my heartThe way you doSo I'm gonna try to give herThe best love that I canIf she just helps me get over you.If she just picks me up when I get downIf she's there when the memoriesWalk aroundMaybe somedayI'll love herAs much as I love youIf she just helps me get over you.I don't suppose that lovin'Will ever be the sameBut she wants meThe way I wanted youSo I'm gonna try to give herThe best love that I canIf she just helps me get over you.If she just picks me up when I get downIf she's there when the memoriesWalk aroundMaybe somedayI'll love herAs much as I love youIf she just helps me get over you
If you could read my mind love, What a tale my thoughts could tellJust like an old time movie, 'Bout a ghost from a wishin' wellIn a castle dark or a fortress strongWith chains upon my feet,You know that ghost is me.And I will never be set free, As long as I'm a ghost you can't see.If I could read your mind love,What a tale your thoughts could tellJust like a paperback novel, The kind the drugstore sellWhen you reach the part Where the heartaches comeThe hero would be me, Heroes often failAnd you won't need that book again, Because the ending's just too hard to take.I'd walk away like a movie starWho gets burned in a freeway script, Enter number twoA movie queen to play the scene, Of bringing all the good things out in meBut for now love let's be real, I never thought I could act this wayAnd I've got to say that I just don't get itI don't know where we went wrongBut the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back.If you could read my mind love, What a tale my thoughts could tellJust like an old time movie, 'Bout a ghost from a wishin' wellIn a castle dark or a fortress strongWith chains upon my feet, The story always endsAnd if you read between the linesYou'll know that I'm just tryin' to understandThe feelings that you lackI never thought I could feel this wayAnd I've got to say that I just don't get it.I don't know where we went wrongBut the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back...
If you love me won't you love me like you love meIf you want me won't you touch me like you want meOh baby just hold me tight I need to know that you mean it tonightIf you love me won't you love me like you love meThe night's still and warm we lie alone in the darkI light a cigarette watch your silhouette next to meNot a word is said but a million things go through my headAnd I wonder why our love's not like it used to beSomething tells me I'm losing you but oh baby don't let it be trueIf you love me won't you love me...So I reach out to you you come to me like you used toBut something's changed it don't feel the same anymoreOh show me we're not through oh baby I'm begging youIf you love me won't you love me...

I can see your heart is achingHe hurt you more than he knewBut should you ever want to love againI'll be faithful to youYou've been crying like a willowWhen the night bird sings so blueTrust was broken but hearts will healAnd I'll be faithful to you.In this world of pain and sorrowWhere a promise won't hold trueHere's a vow you can be sure ofI'll be faithful to youSo let me dry away your lonesome tearsLike the sun melts morning dewAnd I will wrap you up in true, true loveAnd I'll be faithful to youIn this world of pain and sorrowWhere a promise won't hold trueHere's a vow you can be sure ofI'll be faithful to youI'll be faithful to you

It wasn't easy and I know it,You'd been alone much too long, I had a job places to go,But I'd rather be right here at home,He had the time he could give you,When your lips could never find mine,And our little home was payin' the price,Of love left on the vine,Forgiveness is something,I guess it comes with time,But even at best,There's one thing I know,I'll forgive but I'll never forget,I guess when it's over it's over,And your time is no longer mine,But I never meant to cause all the pain,I just wanted your love for mine,And forgiveness is something,I guess it comes with time,But even at best,There's one thing I know,I'll forgive but I'll never forget,
Your bags are packed and waitin' By the door If you really want me to go it's alrightDon't worry 'bout me darling I'll get by But I'll need someone to hold me When I cryI'll need someone to tell me I'll get over youI'll need a friend to lean on When I'm feeling blueSo sit down here beside me After you say goodbye'Cause I'll need someone to hold Me when I cryBut I know the taxi's waitin' for you to goBut darling tell him that you've changed your mindAnd stay until tomorrow 'Cause I know tonightI'll need someone to hold me When I cryI'll need someone to tell meI'll get over youI'll need a friend to lean on When I'm feeling blueSo sit down here beside me After you say goodbye'Cause I'll need someone to hold Me when I cry...

I'LL TAKE YOUR LOVE AT ANYTIME BABYI have seen this old, cold world go gold and silver crazy.Some people live to fill their pocket and it never seizes to amaze me.If money can buy them happiness, that o'right for them I guess.Money sure can buy a lot, but it can't buy what I've got.CHORUS:I'll take your love at anytime babyIt's solid as a rock, bigger than the skyI'll take your love at anytime babyI know it will be there as time goes byI know I can count on you to keep the juices flowingThis thing between a man and woman beats anything else goingTalk of fortune and talk about fameIt sounds nice is the way to tame
Solitaire I'm gettin' good at solitaireI've got lots of times to spare I'm gettin' good without you hereTelephone I'm good at listenin' for the phoneI'm good at hopin' you call home I'm good at listenin' for the phoneI'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you I'm doin' well at cryin' tooI could be the best at bein' blue I'm gettin' good at missin' youBedroom walls I'm good at starin' at the wallsDreamin' footsteps in the hall I'm good at starin' at the wallsI'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you...I'm gettin' good at thinkin' of you...
I ain't gonna marry in the fall I ain't gonna marry in the springCause I'm in love with a pretty little girl who wears a diamond ringAnd I'm just a country boy money have I noneBut I've got silver in the stars And gold in morning sun gold in morning sunNever gonna kiss the ruby red lips of the prettiest girl in townNever gonna ask her if she'd marry me I know she'd turn me downCause I'm just a country boyNever could afford a store bought ring with the sparkling diamond stoneAll I could afford is a loving heart the only one I ownCause I'm just a country boy

Love comes once they sayIf it's the real thingMe I feel that wayKnowing you must be thereWaiting for me somewhereSome people say that I'm a foolBut I'm still looking for you.Yes, I guess it's sad the lovers I've been throughSome I could have hadBut they never were enoughNobody measures upLovers and friends I've had a fewBut I'm still looking for you.Maybe it's wrong, I don't knowMaybe I'm just chasing rainbowsBut its gotta be for ever when I fallBut lately my hopes have been sinkingLately, I find I've been thinkingMaybe you're not really there at all.Tears and years go by and I haven't found itSeems the dream should dieBut I hang on somehowStill I keep reaching outWith all the loves that I've been throughI'm still looking for you
Love's Endless WarDon WilliamsLOVE'S ENDLESS WARHearts have been brokenIn the game of true loveI'm afraid to surrenderI'm not strong enoughGive it all awayOpen up every doorMy heart is a castle in love's endless warDreams can betray youWhen you're far out that seaMany proud hearts have founderedOn love's mutinyGive it all awayBe a young fool once moreMy heart is an island adrift from your shoreIn love's endless war

Down the way where the nights are gay And the sun shines gaily on the mountain top I took a trip on a sailing ship But when I reached Jamaica I made a stopBut I'm sad to say I'm on my way Won't be back for many a dayMy heart is down my head is spinning aroundI had to leave a little girl in Kingston townSounds of laughter everywhere And the dancing girls swaying to and froI must declare my heart is there Though I've been from Maine to MexicoBut I'm sad to say I'm on my way Won't be back for many a dayMy heart is down my head is spinning aroundI had to leave a little girl in Kingston townDown at the market you can hear ladies Cry out while on their heads they bearAckey rice salt fish are nice And the run is good anytime of the yearBut I'm sad to say I'm on my way Won't be back for many a dayMy heart is down my head is spinning aroundI had to leave a little girl in Kingston townSad to say I'm on my way...

There's a young man sits by the riverGot his head held down in his handsThere's a lost love in every teardropAnd reasons that he just don't understandThere's a dirt road runs by the riverComes an old man stepping highWith a soft voice & kind intentionsHe said son you know you're too young to crySome things were meant to just roll by[Chorus]You've got to learn to let it go, when love lets you downLearn to let it go, so you don't miss the one waiting to be foundWith a love that's going to bring you roundOnly love is going to bring you aroundHe said now I know it's hard to imagineThat one day you wont feel so bad.I know you're going to take comfortFrom this experience that I've had.
Leaving For The FlatlandsDon WilliamsAlbum: FlatlandsSweetly flows the water from the mountainSoftly falls the rain upon the leavesGently blows the breeze among the cedarsQuietly my heart is on its kneesHow could anything in all creationBe more beautiful than all I seeWith it all my heart is not rejoicingBecause the one I love is not with meSomewhere in between us was a differenceNot we or all this beauty could secureAnd I know now my heart will ache foreverAnd I wonder if this mountain can endureSo l'm leavin'for the flatlandsGoin' back where I was conceivedGoin' back where nobody knows the differenceThis mountain knows too much about meI though it was written up in heavenThat you would be with me and I with youSun and moon and stars must feel the differenceAnd they're wishin' there was somethin' they could do
Sweetly flows the water from the mountainSoftly falls the rain upon the leavesGently blows the breeze among the cedarsQuietly my heart is on its knees.How could anything in all creationBe more beautiful than all I seeWith it all my heart is not rejoicingBecause the one I love is not with me.Somewhere in between us was a differenceNot we or all this beauty could secureAnd I know now my heart will ache foreverAnd I wonder if this mountain can endure.So l'm leavin' for the flatlandsGoin' back where I was conceivedGoin' back where nobody knows the differenceThis mountain knows too much about me.--- Instrumental ---I though it was written up in heavenThat you would be with me and I with youSun and moon and stars must feel the differenceThey're wishin' there was somethin' they could do.So l'm leavin' for the flatlandsGoin' back where I was conceivedGoin' back where nobody knows the differenceThis mountain knows too much about me.This mountain knows too much about me...
I guess as a lover I have a ways to goWhen someone wants you they should just say it's soBut you'll understand if you'll take my handThen we can dance real slow.To something on the radio.Listen to the radioListen to the radio.Let's spend the night togetherBaby don't goThey sing it on the radio.The words I'd sayDon't seem to sound as realThe songs they playThat's how I really feel.Listen to the radioListen to the radio.Let's spend the night togetherBaby don't goThey sing it on the radio.I try to find a way to explain to youWhat's on my mindAnd not sound so plain to youBut you'll realize if you'll close your eyesThe feelings my words can't slow.They're playing on the radio.Listen to the radio ...


Looking back over my life I can see where I caused you strifeBut I know yes I know I'd never make that same mistake againLooking back over my deeds I can see signs of wise man heedsBut if I just have a chance I'd never make that same mistake againOnce my cup was overflowing I gave nothing in returnNow I can begin to tell you what a lesson I have learnedLooking back over the slate I can see love turn to hateBut I know yes I know I'll never make that same mistake againBut I know yes I know I'll never make that same mistake again
Well I grew up wild and free walking these fields in my bare feetThere wasn't no place I couldn't go with a twenty-two rifle and a fishing poleWell I live in the city but don't fit in you know it's a pity the shape I'm inBut I got no home and I got no choice oh Lord have mercy on a country boyWhen I was young I remember well I'd hunt the wild turkey and the bob-white quailThe river was clear and deep back then and fishin' lines tied to the willow limbWell I live in the city...Well they dammed the river they dammed the streamThey cut down the cypress and the sweet gum treesThere's a laundra mat and a barber shop and now the whole meadow is a parking lotWell I live in the city...

My baby changes like the weatherOne day she's warm, and then she's coldBut someday, I'll understand her betterIn about a thousand years or so[Chorus:]But as long as there's blue sky above meAs long as there's life in my handsMy baby knows I always will beHer lovin', understandin' manMy baby rocks me like the oceanDon't know which way she's gonna goBut, maybe, someday she'll find directionIn about a thousand years or so[Chorus]

[Chorus:]I've been loving you so long nowWhat I'd give if I could see you once againJust to throw my arms around youAnd live those happy times againLovely lady, it seemed so rightWhen I held you all through the nightI could see me forever loving youI never thought of losing you[Chorus]Hungry lovers - we used to cling so tightWhisper softly all through the nightAnd I remember so many loving daysI can't believe they've slipped away[Chorus]
I've been rained on I've been wind blownTook a wrong road every now and thenI've been passed up once or twice stuckAnd I thought love was just around the bendBut lately my hope was wearing thinIt's a lonesome and endless highway I've been searching for so longAfter all the miles I've travelled loving you's like coming homeI've been left flat I've been laughed atWound up right back where I started fromBeen the wrong way down a one wayAnd I thought some day my day would comeBut lately I'd almost given upIt's a lonesome and endless highway...Well I've been flagged down I've been turned roundAnd all that I found was a dead end streetI've been stranded marked and brandedTreated underhanded by everyone I meetBut lately my dream is gettin' weak'Cause it's a lonesome and endless highway...It's a lonesome and endless highway...
Maggie's up each morning at four amBy five at the counter at the dinerHer trucker friends out on the road will soon be stoppin inAs the lights go on at Cafe CarolinaMaggie's been a waitress here most all her lifeThirty years of coffee cups and sore feetThe mountains around Ashville she's never seen the other sideCloser now to fifty than to fortyMaggie's never had a loveShe said she's never had enoughTime to let a man into her lifeAw but Maggie has a dreamShe's had since she was seventeen To find a husband and be a wifeMaggie knows the truckers most by first nameWhat they'll have to say and what they'll orderAnd they take her in their stories to places far awayAnd leave her with the dishes, dreams and quartersAnd she relies upon the jukebox on the lonely afternoonWhen the business starts to slow down she plays the saddest tunesAnd she stares off down the highway and she wonders where it goesNobody to go home to and it's almost time to close
Wish I had a magic carpet together we could flyWe could sail away forever watch the world go byIf I'd had Alladin's lantern I'd know just what to do'Cause all I'd need to do is touch it to make my dreams come trueBut I don't have a magic carpet magic lamps are hard to findAnd I can't conjure up a secret potion to steal your heart and make you mineAll I've got is a four-leaf clover it's my only good luck charm But I get a magic feeling all over thinkin' about you in my armsNo I don't have a magic carpet...All I've got is a four-leaf clover...
You came to me like a dove on the windAs great as your beauty was your freedom withinYou said to me the things on your mindBut I didn't help you I couldn't unwindMaybe I should have held you Maybe I should have triedMaybe I could have helped You through the nightMaybe I should know better Sometimes which way to go Maybe I just don't knowSometimes the ground looks as hard as a rockBut sometimes it's muddy and so hard to walkSometimes the beauty is covered with snowSometimes the right seems the wrong way to goMaybe I should have held you Maybe I should have triedMaybe I could have helped You through the nightMaybe I should know better Sometimes which way to go Maybe I just don't know
I'll love you forever and a day that's what the love songs like to sayIn love it seems life is but a dream when we started out it felt that wayBut it didn't take us very long to find out the world is not a songLife gets blue and love does too you learn to forgive and just go onMaybe that's all it takes just lettin' go of the old mistakesHoldin' on tight to the love we make maybe that's all it takes[ piano ]We've done our share of slamming doors and wondering what we're together forYes we've been through a tear or two and for every tear I'll love you moreAnd maybe that's all it takes...Maybe that's all it takes...

You give to me what life should be for everyone.You're my pepper, you're my salt, my favorite tea.You're my sunset on the ocean, my desert dawn.So much of you is now a part of me.I know a greater power must have noticed me,And decided I would meet someone like you.No-one on this planet thought we could ever be,Till He gave my heart to you, and yours to me.You've given us our children and a recipe:For you and I, love comes naturally.My love is somehow different than I'd have it be,An' it's workin' on my heart, not into me.So I know a greater power must have noticed me,And decided I would meet someone like you.No-one on this planet thought we could ever be,Till He gave my heart to you, and yours to me.

Well we've had our troubles, we've had our hard timesWere some might have stumbled, we've always survivedSometimes love weakens, when the chips are all downBut what we've got together gets stronger somehow(bridge)Pressure makes Diamonds much harder than stoneAnd they only get finer as each day goes onWe've been through some bad times but we made it somehow'cause if pressure makes diamonds, our love's a diamond by nowWell we know the feelin' when the world closes inWe've been there before, love, and we might go againThe road may get rocky life may get hardBut the whole world together can't tear us apart(repeat bridge)

Pretty little baby, lying in a mangerStaring at the strangers, who've come so many milesThey were told to follow the star up in the heavensAnd it brought them to the stable of the little baby childCould this be the kingdom of the high and mightyIs this the ruler, born here tonightShould we lay our treasures, here by the cradleOh you must be the Savior, pretty little baby childSometimes the greatest of miraclesCome from the smallest of thingsThey knew when they knelt there beside himThey were looking in the eyes of a kingAnd that his tiny little fingers would bring us togetherFor ever and ever, pretty little baby childWonder of wonders, there in the darknessThe light of the promise, how it shines from his eyesThe angels were singing the hallelujah chorusTo the Savior before us. Pretty little baby childSometimes the greatest of miraclesCome from the smallest of thingsThey knew when they knelt there beside himThey were looking in the eyes of a kingAnd that his tiny little fingers would bring us togetherFor ever and ever, pretty little baby childFor ever and ever pretty little baby child
(Wayland Holyfield / Jim Rushing)Its hard to hide a lingering disappointmentBut most of the time I wear it wellBur there are times when I just cant help remembering The night you left, that rainy night when my whole future fell.Rainy nights and memories go togetherAnd with every drop of rain I feel the painI can almost hear my pleading, On the night you were leavingBut I might have well have tried to stop the rain.--- Instrumental ---The blowing wind that moans outside my windowSeems to echo the closing of a doorFor it was then I first realized I had heard your last goodbyeAnd my whole world went crumbling to the floor.Rainy nights and memories go togetherAnd with every drop of rain I feel the painI can almost hear my pleading, On the night you were leavingBut I might have well have tried to stop the rain..
I ran into an old friend of mine the other day. We hadn't seen each other for quite a while. What he had to say to me hit me pretty hard, 'cause I think a lot of folks get started this way. He said:I thought it would be so easy, another one night stand.			She seemed so warm and willin', right in the palm of my hand.		Now it's three months ago last Wednesday since I woke up in her bed.	Lord I think I love her, but it scares me half to death.		'Cause you know I'm a rake and a ramblin' man				Free as an eagle flies						Well, look at me now and tell me true:					Do I look like a daddy to you?						 Oh, do I look like a daddy to you?						 Now she's feelin' sick in the mornin's; She can't get into her jeans.	I spent my last ten dollars, bought her a second hand ring.		I start to work next Monday 'cause I just can't let her down.		 I've had me some good times, but it's all changin' now.			 You know I'm a rake and a ramblin' man,					Free as an eagle flies.						Well look at me now and tell me true:					Do I look like a daddy to you?						Oh, do I look like a daddy to you?						You know I'm a rake and a ramblin' man,					Free as an eagle flies.							Well look at me now and tell me true:					Do I look like a daddy to you?						Oh, do I look like a daddy to you?

First I was love, then I came to beI had a heart inside of meAnd though my heart was working I foundStill there was something it had not foundSo I went away hoping to seeMaybe I'd find what's missing in meKnowing so well but not knowing whyIf I didn't find this something I'd dieAnd then I came to where I had beenI knew the first was still not the endWhat I had left was not what I foundBecause there was you, because there I foundFirst I was love, then I came to beI had a heart inside of meAnd though me heart is still part of meYou gave my heart its reason to be
If I listen long enough to youI'd find a way to believe its all trueKnowing that you lied straight faced while I criedStill I'd look to find a reason to believeSomeone like youMakes it hard to live without somebody elseSomeone like youMakes it easy to give and never think of myselfIf I gave you time to change my mindI'd find a way and I'd leave the past behindKnowing that you lied straight faced while I cryStill I'd look to find a reason to believeSomeone like youMakes it hard to live without somebody elseSomeone like youMakes it easy to give and never think of myselfIf I gave you time to change my mindI'd find a way and I'd leave the past behindKnowing that you lied straight faced while I cryStill I'd look to find a reason to believe
RestlessDon WilliamsTim Williams,Don WilliamsAlbum: FlatlandGive me too many bad signs,I'll be gone and I can tell you whyRight or wrong that's just the way I amI'm not looking for sympathy, we either do or we don't agreeAll I need to know is where I standSo it's comin' right down to you,I wanna stay.if you want me toBut I don't wanna waste your time,So I don't want you wastin' mineWhen the sun's sinkin' low, I get so restlessShould I stay or go, that is the questionI really need to feel that you'll neverLeave me alone, maybe that's all I really need to knowMaybe I get too impatient, when I sense your reservationsI guess I'm, just scared you'll say goodbye'cause I would hope I've let you know what it's like inside your loveI pray it lasts for more than just awhileSo it's time to make up your mind either way I will surviveNot knowing is enough for me to ride awayWith a broken dreamWhen the sun's sinkin' low, I get so restlessShould I stay or go, that is the questionI really need to feel that you'll neverLeave me alone, maybe that's all I really need to know
WITH THE POZO SECO SINGERSWRITER GORDON LIGHTFOOTRibbon of darkness over meSince my true love walked out the doorTears I never had beforeRibbon of darkness over me Clouds are gathering over my headThat kill the day and hide the sunThat shroud the night when day is doneRibbon of darkness over me Rain is falling on the meadowWhere once my love and I did lieNow she is gone from the meadowMy love goodbye Ribbon of darkness over meWhere once the world was young as springWhere flowers did bloom and birds would singRibbon of Darkness over me In this cold room lyingDon't want to see no one but youLord, I wish I could be dyingTo forget you How I wish your old heart could seeHow mine just takes and breaks all dayCome on back and take awayRibbon of Darkness over me Come on back and take awayRibbon of Darkness over me

WRITER PAT McLAUGHLINThey got a road out in Alaska now,I hear that you can go there.Tell me about Montana,With the cool blue mountain air.I know your honeys got the money,I can understand your wanderlust.Brother, and boy, for me these days,Its refrigerator or bust.I ain't got no words for going,I got no longing for your open road.Don't get found rollin' into town tugging on a heavy load.You've gotta give me the nights with the city lights, and the people buzzin' everywhere.One hand upon the parking meter, the other on her easy chair.I'll send her roses, send her roses everyday.If I don't go down another dirt road, I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.I'll send her roses, send her roses once in awhile.I'm a long, long way from outta here, but you know I'm gonna go in style.Well, I was rollin' around Boston town, wasn't hardly anybody I know.Got to singin' low for the first three rows, puttin' on a lousy show.Well then I met her, I had to let her buy my lunch, I got the flowery plate.I'm telling you why, good brother don't laugh, think I got me one suitable mate.I'll send her roses, send her roses every day.If I don't go down another dirt road, I don't think it's gonna hurt my day.I'll send her roses, send her roses by the dozen.I've been having me a whirl with a pretty girl,And she told me she liked my lovin'.(repeat last bridge)

Faded pictures, yellow from time. Well worn memories of days gone by. Needing someone and nobody's there. These are the things broken dreams are made of, Lord they're everywhere.Tears of the lonely keep falling all the time, tears of the lonely never dry.Another nightime that just never ends. A helpless longing for what might have been. Another morning to face all alone.

Ten years ago on a cold dark nightA man was killed underneath the town hall lightThere were few at the scene but they all agreedThat the slayer who ran, looked a lot like meThe judge said, "Son what is your alibi?"If you were somewhere else then you won't have to dieWell I spoke not a word though it meant my lifeFor I had been in the arms of my best friends wifeShe walks these hills in a long black veilShe visits my grave when the night winds wailNobody knows nobody seems nobody knows but meThe scaffold is high an eternity nearsShe stood in the crowd shed not a tearBut sometimes at night when the cold winds moanShe comes to my grave and she cries on my bonesShe walks these hills in a long black veilShe visits my grave when the night winds wailNobody knows nobody seems nobody knows but me
THE OLD TRAILWRITERS CHARLES JOHN QUARTO, STEVE GILLETTEThere's a new ridge road that cuts the mountain to the bone. Slices through the woods like there ain't nobody home. You wheel on up the valley view. You'll never feel the climb. Oh but I'll take the old trail every time.The old trail, just mosies right along, moves at the speed of a sweet love song and the wind through the trees carries her own wind chimes. Yeah I'll take the old trail every time.Lately it seems things vanish by degrees. How soon we forget we made our tree houses out of trees. When we going to realize some reasons just don't rhyme. Yeah I take the old trail every time.The old trail. Now may she never fade. The one where the deer always have the right of way. How I love to watch the wintergreen along the timber lines. Yes I'll take the old trail every time.People all in cars let the radios do the talking but I always find that I'm singing when I'm walking.The old trail just mosies right along. Moves at the speed of a sweet love song and the wind through the trees carries her own wind chimes. Yeah I'll take the old trail every time. I take the old trail every time.
Some say love, it is a riverThat drowns the tender reedSome say love, it is a razerThat leaves your soul to bleedSome say love, it is a hungerAn endless aching needI say love, it is a flowerAnd you, it's only seedIt's the heart afraid of breakingThat never learns to danceIt's the dream afraid of wakingThat never takes the chanceIt's the one who won't be takenWho cannot seem to giveAnd the soul afraid of dyingThat never learns to liveWhen the night has been too lonelyAnd the road has been too longThat you think that love is onlyFor the lucky and the strongJust remember in the winterFar beneath the bitter snowLies the seed that with the sun's loveIn the spring becomes the rose

I thought I'd be an angelAnd fly on astral skiesI thought I'd wear a fanciful disguiseAnd It's taken me a lotta timeTo find out I'm not oneAn outlaw on the run,On this side of the sun.I hoped I'd be a championAnd live without a careI thought I'd change the world,Make it just and fairBut my youth slipped by before my eyesMuch to my surpriseBefore I had begun,On this side of the sun.Out on this end of the windWinter's coming 'round the bendYou pray for rain, before you know,You're standin' in a foot of snowSo you pull your coat up to your chinPick your shovel up again'Cause your work is never done,On this side of the sun.[Instrumental]I took it to a fortune tellerI thought that she might help meShe looked into my eyesAnd smiled mysteriouslyBut she didn't know as much as meI stared back, dejectedly'Cause I know where she's from,This side of the sun.Out behind these prison walls,Dark clouds come and hard rains fallYou pause a moment for a dream,They row you gently down the streamYou wake up angry in the night,Jump up, ready for the fightBut the war is never wonOn this side of the sun.Now they tell me musicCan free a person's soulSo I sing a song everywhere I goBut It's not much different than beforeI'm still looking for the doorI wonder if there is one,On this side of the sun...
Knowing you stand by me through good and badMakes all the difference in my lifeAnd day by day sweetheart I findThese are the ties that bindThe little things you do that please me soThe way you always understandWhen simple joys bring peace of mindThese are the ties that bindYou're all I needTo see me throughCan I say more than this my loveI live just for your kiss my loveAnd I live just for your kiss my loveForever and a day my love will liveThe flame of love will never dieSo heart and soul please say you're mineHeld by the ties that bind

L Martine Jr.Every day of my life until foreverWas spoken for when you looked at meNow that you're gone my life goes onBut all of the heart is out of meAnd I've got time on my handsYou on my mind, nowhere to spend all my loveAnd I'll be here waiting if you ever change your plans'Cause you own this time on my handsEvery morning I see the future before me,Empty, as endless as the sky.I should begin to build life againBut I just can't find a reason why.And I've got time on my handsYou on my mind, nowhere to spend all my loveAnd I'll be here waiting if you ever change your plans'Cause you own this time on my hands
WITH THE POZO SECO SINGERSWRITER BOB DYLANIf today was not an endless highway,If tonight was not a crooked trail,If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all.Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',Only if she was lyin' by me,Then I'd lie in my bed once again.I can't see my reflection in the waters,I can't speak the sounds that show no pain,I can't hear the echo of my footsteps,Or can't remember the sound of my own name.Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',Only if she was lyin' by me,Then I'd lie in my bed once again.There's beauty in the silver, singin' river,There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky,But none of these and nothing else can touch the beautyThat I remember in my true love's eyes.Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin',Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin',Only if she was lyin' by me,Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Getting in deep, losing my sleepThinking of you all the timeI feel I'm falling under your spellAbout to lose my mindBut it's too late to turn back nowIt's too late nowToo late to turn back nowYou got me nowFeel the danger in your touchHaunts me night and dayYou know I want you way too muchBut I can't walk away'Cause it's too late to turn back nowIt's too late nowToo late to turn back nowYou got me nowToo late, it's too late now; you got me nowToo late, it's too late now, you got me now
It's coming all apart babeWith every tearing wordI've lost my taste for what I take from youWhen a painful night of silenceIs the sweetest sound I've heardIf I play your game I'm cheating on the truth[Chorus]It takes too many tears to make love strongToo much of me for me and you to get alongI'd need another lifetime but I'll never last that longIt takes too many tears to make love strongIt takes a lot of livingA lot of going throughTo finally see and end to going downThere's no getting up my courageFor making up with you'Cause making up just finds another round[Chorus x2]
Too much coffee, too much tea, too much sugar isn't good for me. Too much money and too much fame, too much liqueur drives a man insane.But too much love, too much love, there's no such thing as too much love.Too much fighting and misery, ther's too much trouble in this world for me. There's too much of this and too much of that and too much of anything will make you fat.But too much love, too much love, there's no such thing as too much love.Too many people saying don't do that, it's a no, no, no, no, no. I don't need telling where it's at I said I know, know, know, know, know, know.Too much pleasure and too much pain, somewhere someone's getting too much rain and too much junk's Being advertised and too much television hurts your eyes.But too much love, too much love, there's no such thing as too much love.
You have your ways, I sure have mineWe have our days, things go just fineThen there are days we?d leave if we couldShould we break it off when it?s not that good?Fair weather minds need the sunshineIt has to show which way to goBut true blue hearts see through the darkAnd keep our minds on days of sunshineEach of us knows, try as we mayThose bad old days keep coming our wayWe're digging in, there's just no retreatToo many we know are down in defeatFair weather minds need the sunshineIt has to show which way to goBut true blue hearts see through the darkAnd keep our minds on days of sunshine
Adam met Eve on a Saturday night That's when the trouble startedShe said Adam let's go for a bite She led him to the gardenAnd ever since then We tried to make sense Of this mystery emotionBut we might as well try To count the stars in the skiesOr those raindrops in the oceanWill you know it's true love Deeper than deep Hotter than the fireWhen it's hard to find And it's harder to keep It's the thing we most desireI was alone for so many nights I really started to wonderIf I had run out of chances to find A spell I could fall underThen you walked in Like in an Elvis film You were singing Love Me TenderI was hypnotized By your blue eyes And the next thing I rememberWill you know it's true love Deeper than deep Hotter than the fireWhen it's hard to find And it's harder to keep It's the thing we most desireAnd there is a true love In a winking eye and A sweet perfume that lingersAnd it's an I love you On a new tattoo and That diamond on her fingerWill you know it's true love Deeper than deep Hotter than the fireWhen it's hard to find And it's harder to keep It's the thing we most desire

TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMASWRITER CLEMENT CLARK MOORET'was the night before Christmas,  when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, --not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,  in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,  Had just settled down for a long winter's nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,  I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash,  Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow  Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,  But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,  With a little old driver, so lively and quick,  I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.  More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; "Now, DASHER! now, DANCER! now, PRANCER and VIXEN!  On, COMET! on CUPID! on, DONDER and BLITZEN!  To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"  As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,  When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.  And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof  The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,  Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT."

Walkin' down this midnight streetJust the sound of two lonely feetWalkin' a broken heartWalkin' a broken heartEmpty city, not a soul in sightAnd a misty rain falls on a perfect nightTo walk a broken heartTo walk a broken heartAnd I know that you're thinkin'This couldn't happen to youBut you're a fool for believingDreams don't fly away, cause they do.So if you've been hurt and you're feelin' lostJust put your paperback back and turn your t.v. offAnd walk your broken heart,Walk your broken heart.Walk your broken heart.Walk your broken heart.Walk your broken heart.

I want to be a worker I want to sing and prayI never want to be a stumbling block along the wayBut in the hour of living so many people sayThey all have all the answers but they all have different waysBut we can sing glory hallelujah brother we can singIf we put our hearts together and we prayNo one really has to tell us what to say maybe we can really find the wayWell I hope it comes together instead of all apart'Cause the better things of living are written in our heartsBut on the stage this morning the trouble is the starHappiness is measured by houses and our carsBut we can sing glory hallelujah...But we can sing glory hallelujah...

Today we laid old man Pate to restHis big hands folded across his chestGod rest his soul just two days agoHe was in his yard waving to meAs I stood by his grave the impression was strongOne minute we're here and the next we're goneAnd with each breath of life that is given to usWe should only have time for loveSo tell me what can be gained by fussing and fightingThe answer is left up to usI think it's time we learned enough is enoughOh we should only have time for loveSometimes I'm unwilling to open my eyesJust too stubborn to compromiseWhen you stand your ground oh there's no backing downThat makes for a long bitter fightAnd you know it's such a waste to engage in thatTearing each other down in a tit for tatWhen we could be hard at work building a trustOh we should only have time for loveSo tell me what can be gained by fussing and fighting...Well isn't it time we learned enough is enoughOh we should only have time for love
There's no cause to think that I won't stay Haven't I been with you all the way There's no time like now to make amends Cause after all we're more than friends[Chorus]This could be the time for you and me We could go wherever we should be So don't put words between us we shouldn't say Don't be acting half way, when you know we're all the wayThere are times that I don't see the light and I don't know if what I do is right When I'm wrong it's never meant for you so don't confuse my love with what I do[Chorus]
There's a storm rollin' over the hillAnd the willow trees are blowin'I'm standin' here starin' out the windowSafe and warmI feel her put her arms around meAnd its a good feelin' I'm knowin'Oh, I've got a good woman and we've got a good fire goin'We've got a feast on the supper tableBread for breakin'A blessing from the Lord for makin' me such a fortunate manThe light of my life in the candleHer face a glowin'Oh, I've got a good woman and we've got a good fire goin'[Chorus]So let it rain(let the rain fall down)Let it rainIt won't do nothin' but kindle a never ending flameLet it rain(let the rain fall down)Let it rain til mornin'Oh, I've got a good woman and we've got a good fire goin'Now there's a hard rain fallin' on the roofCoffee comin' from the kitchenI'm lyin' here listenin' to the ceiling on the living room floorI feel her lay down beside meMy love is overflowin'Oh, I've got a good woman and we've got a good fire goin'Oh, I've got a good woman and we've got a good fire goin'

I see her walkin' down the streetWhat does it matter to meAnd I can wonder who she might beWhat does it matter to meIs there someone whoShe could be runnin' toShe's gonna do what she's gonna doWhat does it matter to meSeems she's everywhere I lookWhat does it matter to meAnd her looks could fill a bookWhat does it matter to meThere's no need for me to tryOr even wonder whyJust let her walk on byOn winter's eve, my soul has soaredWith desert's evening skyBut never seen the beauty, I see in her eyes
What's the score? I can't tell anymoreAre we winning, are we losing, are we tied?What's the score? It ain't what it was beforeCan anybody tell me what's the score?I hurt you and you hurt meSeems we both just try to seeHow far we can push each other's heartsAnd it's a never ending gameWhere the rules don't stay the sameAnd the more we playThe more we're forced apartWhat's the score? I can't tell anymoreAre we winning, are we losing, are we tied?What's the score? It ain't what it was beforeCan anybody tell me what's the score?I forgive and you do tooSeems that's all we ever doAnd I'm not sure who's turn it is todayI break your heart, you break mineWe're about to cross the lineWhere the game of loves no longer fun to playWhat's the score? I can't tell anymoreAre we winning, are we losing, are we tied?What's the score? It ain't what it was beforeCan anybody tell me what's the score?
If I could write about the way you make me feelI wonder what I'd writeCause of all the words there are to useThat never say it rightWhen I only have a minute and It'd take a thousand hoursAnd some new words tooBut my nights are never blueAnd I don't mind the rain when I'm with youWhen I'm with you the songs are already writtenMelodies turn into words nobody's ever saidWhen I'm alone the only thing I can say that's trueIs my nights are never blueAnd I don't mind the rain when I'm with youSo if I could write about the way you make me feelI don't know what I'd writeCause of all the words there are to useThat never say it rightWhen I only have a minute and It'd take a thousand hoursAnd all those new words tooBut my nights are never blueAnd I don't mind the rain when I'm with you
You call me up at five to five, and you ask me if I'll drop byThat you need me, tonight you're all aloneLike the fool I am and the fool I'll be, I drove there anxiouslyBut when I got there, you were not alone[Chorus:]When will I ever learn that you'll never care about me?You only build me up to bring me down againWhen will I ever learn that you'll use me and abuse me?Oh, tell me; when will I ever learn?When will I learn, when will I get wise; you never apologizeI swear that this time I'm through with youLike the fool I am and the fool I'll be, the next time you need meOnce again I'll give in to you[Chorus]
Where is the sun where is the day I'm looking for?Where is the moon where are the stars that'd shine before?Where are you where are you?Where is the time when hours were like minutes here before?Where are the nights when it was warm even on the floor?Where are you where are you?Where are the eyes that looked at me with love and nothing more?Where are the arms that made me feel so welcome at the door?Where are you where are you?
The groceries are gone, my pay cheque is spent.They turned off the water; I'm behind on my rent.Last night I drank my last beer,And where do I go from here? I've been laid off since Monday before.The union is holdin' out, hopin' for more.Well, I could be laid off for years.Oh, where do I go from here?Where do I go from here? Sittin' at the kitchen table,Staring at my unpaid bills.Sometimes I feel so unable:It's the boredom, not the worry that kills.Oh where do I go from here. Where do you go when nobody needs you?Why can't you sleep when there's nothin' else to do?And why are your thoughts so unclear?Oh, where do you go? Where do you go?Where do you go from here? I don't like complaining and I could use a rest,But my sofa and chairs just got repossessed.And my pride is the next thing, I fear.Oh, where do I go? Where do I go?Where do I go from here? Tell me where do I go? Where can I go?Where can I go from here? 
Where the Arkansas River leaves Oklahoma It runs free and rambles muddy and wideWhere the Arkansas River leaves Oklahoma It's gone forever and never looks backI met her in Stillwell she just turned twenty a spirited beauty like I'd never knownAnd me a dirt farmer who lives by the riverBut she said she loved me and the free life I ownedWe married in April and lived by the river we worked that land from spring till the fallBut I guess when the winter howled at our windowShe couldn't help hearing that wild river callWhere the Arkansas River leaves Oklahoma It runs free and rambles muddy and wideWhere the Arkansas River leaves Oklahoma It's gone forever and never looks backShe tried to conquer that wild rage within herBut something too strong ran deep in her soulBut I know she loved me she cried like a babyThat cold winter evening she answered the callWhere the Arkansas River leaves Oklahoma It runs free and rambles muddy and wideWhere the Arkansas River leaves Oklahoma It's gone forever and never looks back

I went to see my honeydew; she lived just down the wayI got stuck, and the truck froze up; and I only got half waySittin' here on the muddy road, stuck here all aloneThe rain won't stop it's a-beatin' on the top, and I should have stayed at homeI wish I was in Nashville, guitar on my backMaybe someday I will ride in the back of a big CadillacMust have been a half a day before I got back homeThe road's all mud, the creek's gonna flood, and I'm here all aloneSure feels good a-gettin' back to my old shack againBut I'm all soaked and the radios broke and the rain keeps pouring inI wish I was in Nashville, guitar on my backMaybe someday I will ride in the back of a big CadillacI wish I was in Nashville, guitar on my backMaybe someday I will ride in the back of a big Cadillac

It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wearShe puts on her make-up, brushes her long blond hairAnd then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"We go to a party, everyone turns to seeThis beautiful lady walking around with meAnd then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"I feel wonderfulBecause I see the love light in your eyesAnd the wonder of it allYou just don't realize how much I love youIt's time to go home now, I've got an aching headSo I give her the car keys, she helps me to bedAnd then I tell her as I turn out the light"Oh, my darling, you were wonderful tonightOh, my darling, you were wonderful tonight"

Years from now, I'll want you years from nowI'll hold you years from now as I hold you tonightYou are my one true friend always my one true friendAnd I'll love you till life's end, as I love you tonightI know this world that we live in can be hard now and thenAnd it will be again, many times we've been downStill love has kept us together for the flame never diesWhen I look in your eyes the future I seeHolding you years from nowWanting you years from nowLoving you years from nowAs I love you tonight
The moon is on the rise it stares at me tonight. I'm reminded of the arms that held me tight. Last time I held you it ended all to soon we were lying underneath a yellow moon.There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon.Sometimes we sit and talk me and that old moon. I ask him are you happy or if you're blue. I start to reminisce to summers night in June, we fell in love underneath a yellow moon.There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon.There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon.

YOU GET TO MEWRITER DON WILLIAMSYou get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,You just can't believe how you get to me.Night after night I've tried holding you tight and then I'll stay away.I've tried holding your hand, being your man and just anyway.When it comes down to feelings it's always the same old song ,My poor hearts just reeling but you act like something's wrong.Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,You just can't believe how you get to me.If I could cry, bring a tear to your eye, maybe that's the way.'Cause were in the strains of living your pains from yesterday.Really got to keep on growing, looking for the brighter day.Like the water that keeps on flowing well I just can't stay away.You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,You just can't believe how you get to me.Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,You just can't believe how you get to me.

Some days I seem so far away from where I want to beAnd the things that I've accomplished seem so smallWhen I'm weary of the struggle and I feel I can't goYou love me through it allYour love gives me a balance when I'm standing on the edgeYou keep me going when my dreams have stalledAnd you're always building bridges even when I'm building wallsYou love me through it allSometimes I come home bragging bout the things I've done that dayLike a thing that I'm on top and cannot fallAnd when I'm high on my successes thinking only of myselfYou love me through it allThrough it all you're there to comfort me you keep my feet on solid groundI know that I can make it as long as you're aroundYour love gives me a balance
There are those to tempt me if I'd let 'emThere are times it gets so hard for meDon't ever make me feel you've left me wishin'Don't ever make me feel you're not with meYour sweet love, love, loveI place none aboveYour sweet love, love, loveLoving meSometimes other ways keep calling to meAnd I don't mean to say I'm not strongBut all the strength I have is what you give meYou're the one I've needed all alongYour sweet love, love, loveI place none aboveYour sweet love, love, loveLoving me
You placed gold on my finger  You brought love like I've never known  You gave life to our children  And to me a reason to go on    You're my friend when I'm hungry  You're my shelter from troubled winds  You're my anchor in life's ocean  But most of all you're my best friend  When I need hope and inspiration  You're always strong when I'm tired and weak  I could search this whole world over  You'd still be everything that I need.
You placed gold on my fingerYou brought love like I've never knownYou gave life to our childrenAnd to me a reason to go on You're my bread when I'm hungryYou're my shelter from troubled windsYou're my anchor in life's oceanBut most of all, you're my best friend When I need hope and inspirationYou're always strong when I'm tired and weakI could search this whole world overYou'd still be everything that I need You're my bread when I'm hungryYou're my shelter from troubled windsYou're my anchor in life's oceanBut most of all, you're my best friend You're my bread when I'm hungryYou're my shelter from troubled windsYou're my anchor in life's oceanBut most of all, you're my best friend
