Each day I'll do a golden deedBy helping those who are in needMy life on earth is but a spanAnd so I'll do the best I canLife's even sun is sinking lowA few more days and I must goTo meet the deeds that I have doneWhere there will be no setting sunTo be a child of God each dayMy light must shine along the wayI'll sing His praise while ages rollAnd strive to help some troubled soulThe only life that will endureIs one that's kind and good and pureAnd so for God I'll take my standEach day I'll lend a helping handI'll help someone in time of needAnd journey on with rapid speedI'll help the sick and poor and weakAnd words of kindness to them speakWhile going down life's weary roadI'll try to lift some travler's loadI'll try to turn the night to dayMake flowers bloom along the way.
Mother first was called to heavenLeft our home all aloneDad took sick soon and joined herThey're reunited on god's throneA few more tiring days still face usA few more weary nights shall comeWe'll all be on our way to heavenWhen a few more seasons comeIn springtime when the flowers blossomSpreading their fragrance through the airWalking through the little churchyardSoon we'll all be resting there
A few more years shall roll, a few more seasons shall comeThen we shall be with those at rest asleep within the tomb Then Oh my Lord prepare my soul for that great dayWash me in Thy precious blood and take my sins all awayA few more meetings here shall cheer us on our wayAnd we shall reach that endless rest on that eternal day
All I ever loved was you   You broke a heart that cried for you   I've wasted all my tears on you   For all I've ever loved was you Go out and find somebody newBut you'll be sorry if you doYou'll never find a love so trueFor all I ever loved was you Buy her rings and diamonds tooBut you'll be sorry if you doYou'll never find a love so true For all I ever loved was you
I even loved the ground that you walked on   But that has been some time ago   I could never take you back, no matter how I try   For all the love I had is gone You told me a lie and I believed youThat's alright if that's the way you want to doGo on my dear now with your new loveYou'll know how it feels when he lies to you

The wind is blowing 'round the cabinI hate to hear that lonesome soundI'm all alone and so down heartedSince my true love she ain't around I hate to see the sun a sinkingAnother night to toss and turnAnother night to dream about herAnother night for her I yearnShe had no cause to go and leave meFor I had never done her wrongShe left our home and little children And with another she has goneThe children they are soundly sleepingNo they don't know that their mother's goneWhat can I do when they awakenI can't tell them that their mother's wrong

Sadly we sing and with tremulous breathAs we stand by the mystical streamIn the valley and by the dark river of deathAnd yet 'tis no more than a dreamOnly a dream, only a dreamOf glory beyond the dark streamHow peaceful the slumber, how happy the wakingWhere death is only a dreamWhy should we weep when the weary ones restIn the bosom of Jesus supremeIn the mansions of glory prepared for the blessedFor death is no more than a dreamNaught in the river the Saints should appallThough' it frightfully dismal may seemIn the arms of our Savior no ill can befallThey find it no more than a dreamOver the turbid and onrushing tideDoth the light of eternity gleamAnd the ransomed the darkness and storm shall out rideTo wake with glad smiles from their dream

It was on one dark and starless nightI heard and saw an awful sightThe lighting flashed and the thunder roaredAll around the drunkard's feet I started home to change my lifeTo see my long neglected wifeI found her kneeling by her bedShe said our darling baby was dead I took her by her trembling handShe was so weak she could not standOn bended knees I prayed a prayerThat God might save and protect us there Who preached like Paul who once did sayOur sins have all been washed awayThat whiskey stay as far from meAs the mountains are from the deep blue sea

I left my old home to ramble this countryMy mother and dad said son don't go wrongRemember that God will always watch o'er youAnd we will be waiting for you here at home    Son don't go astray was what they both told me   Remember that love for God can be found   But now they're both gone this letter just told me   For years they've been dead, the fields have turned brown For many long years this world I have rambledNo thoughts of the day when I would returnNow as I go home and find no one waitingThe price I have paid to live and to learn

Troubles and trials often betray thoseCausing the weary body to strayBut we shall walk beside the still waterWith the good shepherd leading the way    Going up home to live in green pastures   Where we shall live and die never more   Even the Lord will be in that number   When we have reached that heavenly shore Those who have strayed were sought by the masterHe who once gave his life for the sheepOut on the mountain still He is searchingBringing them in forever to keep We will not heed the voice of the strangerFor he would lead us on to despairFollowing home with Jesus our saviorWe shall all reach that country so fair

Thinking of you while out for a rambleDown by a cold frosty streamSet down on a bed of hemlocks and primrosesAnd gently I fell into a dream I dreamed I saw a pretty fair maidenSuch beauty I'd never saw beforeHer dress was bound round with hemlocks and primrosesSo green was the mantel she wore Her hair was of a dark brown colorHer teeth was as ivory so whiteHer eyes they shined like sparking diamondsOr stars than shine on a cold frosty night I drew her near then I awakenedWith two empty arms and you on my mindHeaven seemed so near while I was dreamingIt hurts to know you left me behind

Oh lord have mercy on this weary soul of mine    May I walk in your light everyday   And when I've crossed that deep silent river   I'll be happy in that home far away I wandered away from the straight and the narrowDriftin' like a ship lost at seaNo lighthouse to guide my weary footstepsTil Jesus answered my plea The lights are bright no longer I'm blinded From the bondage of sin I'm freeHe lifted me up to join salvationI'll live on eternally
Get down boys, go back home    Back to the girl you love    Treat her right, never wrong    How mountain girls can love Riding the night in the high cold winds On the trail of the old lonesome pine Thinking of you, feeling so blue Wondering why you left me behind Remember the night we strolled down the lane Our hearts were gay and happy then You whispered to me as I held your close You hoped this night would never end 
Oh, I am the Man, Thomas, I am the Man   Look at these nail scars here in my hands They pierced me in the side, Thomas, I am the ManThey made me bear the cross, Thomas, I am the Man  They laid me in the tomb, Thomas, I am the ManIn three days I arose, Thomas, I am the Man They pierced me in the Side, Thomas, I am the ManThey made me bear the cross, Thomas, I am the Man

Oh it's raining, raining, raining here this morningAs I sit in jail and hang my head in shameWith a smile I try to greet each early dawningBut they've given me a number for my nameMany a little raindrops are falling close to meMakes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can beIt's raining, raining, raining here this morningAs the Mississippi flows on to the seaHow I wish that I could see my little darlingAnd hold her in my arms just as beforeI used to tell her every day I loved herBut now she doesn't love me anymoreShe knew that I was guiltless of this one crimeAnd said that she'd be waiting there for meBut she has found somewhere else to wanderWhere the Mississippi flows on to the seaIts raining, raining, raining here this morningAnd I am just as weary as can beI wish that I could follow all the raindropsDown the Mississippi toward the silver seaBut there's no way to prove that I'm not guiltySo I will have to suffer all the shameGo and tell her for me little raindropsThat they've given me a number for my name
Hallelujah to Jesus who died on the tree   To raise up his ladder of mercy for me   Press onward climb upward the top is in view   There's a crown of bright glory awaiting for you As Jacob was travellin was weary one dayHis head on a stone for a pillow did layA vision appeared of a ladder so highIt stood on the earth while the top reached the sky This ladder was tall and yet so well madeStood thousands of years and never decayedHigh winds from the heaven's they reeled and they rockedBut the angels they guarded from bottom to top

I sit here alone on the banks of the riverThe lonesome wind blows the water rolls highI hear a voice calling out there in the darknessI sit here alone too lonesome to cry    Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight   I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry   The woman I love she left me this morning   With no one to love or kiss me goodnight We met there one night by the banks of the riverSat there holding hands and making our vowsSwore we'd never part and be happy togetherBut a new love she's found she's gone from me now
When we were young we loved each otherMore than anyone will knowBut today you found a new loveAnd you said I had to go    Oh the road is rough and rocky   Since the day I last saw you   Another's won your heart forever   And I'm lonesome without you On down this lonely road I wanderedWith nothing left for me to doWondering if I'll ever see youAnd share the love that we once knew My hope is now that you'll be happyWith the new love that we once knewBut if you ever change your mind dearRemember me I'll be around

Well I wandered way back in the mountainsI was searching for fortune and fameI found where the water runs deep from the hillsThey call it the medicine springsThey call it the medicine springs It was there that I met a fair maidenYellow hair and big eyes of blueShe told me one day she loved only meThat she'd forever be trueThat she'd forever be true Well I wanted the best for my darlin'But my pockets were empty and bareMy love was so great for that starlett of mineI took what another man hadI took what another man had As I sit here alone in this jailhouseWith a letter I can't hardly readIt said my darlin' has left this ol' worldShe's a waitin' in heaven for meShe's a waitin' in heaven for me Some day I'll go back to the mountainsWhere I'll spend the rest of my daysAnd the water that runs frome the side of the hillWill water her flowery graveWill water her flowery grave

On a dark stormy night the angels called motherThe love that we shred for such a short while She called us around and told us she's leavingThen closing her eyes she went with a smile    Mother's at rest in a lonesome old graveyard   On a hill far away there stands her white tomb   With the grass covered o'er it seems so neglected   When the spring season comes sweet flowers will bloom I'll never forget the love mother gave usAs children we played around our old homeI know her reward is a mansion in heavenWhile children on earth are scattered and gone
We were wed in the hills of ol' VirginiaWe were happy there together all aloneBut I strayed away from my darlinThrough this dark and stormy night I'm goin home    When the high wind blows from heaven   I whisper your name alone   I'm on my way back darlin'    As the midnight storm rolls on When the cold dreary rain starts fallinAnd the clouds hide the bright golden moon As I see your face right before me I can cry as I sing this lonesome tune
No matter what I say or do you're never satisfiedI've tried and tried so many times I'm leavin you now good bye    I'm ridin on that midnight train my head's a hangin low   These awful blues will follow me where ever I may go Oh why on earth was I ever born I'll never understandTo fall in love with a woman like you in love with another man You broke a heart that trusted you why wasn't it made of stoneI'm left in a world black as night, yet I must journey on
One night, while the moon from Heaven was shiningMy mother was praying for me to come homeShe asked her dear lord: "Watch over me out yonderTo send me back home to never more roam."When I left my old home way back in the mountainsI said I'd return with honor and fameBut a young reckless heart turned wrong at the crossroadsAnd now as I go home, I bring mother shameWhen I got to the place where I spent my childhoodThe silvery moon was shining so brightWhen I asked my dear friends to tell me of motherThey said she was called on to Heaven last nightShe told them of how she was longing to see meHow lonely her home since I went awaySaid, "Darling, repent and ask for forgivenessAnd meet mother there in heaven some day."Mother has gone to live with the angelsHer soul is at rest around the great throneNow I have no one left here to advise meFor mother no longer awaits me at home
As a boy I learned of Jesus With my mother here at homeGathered there around the firesideMother taught us right from wrongHappy days I still rememberWith a mother long gone onNow rejoicing with the angels (up in heaven)Mother's footsteps guide me onMother's love will always guide usAs I journey on and onThere will be a great reunionMother's footsteps guide me on

Down the road here from me there's an old holler treeWhere you lay down a dollar or twoGo on round the bend come back againthere's a jug full of that good ole mountain dew [CHORUS]Oh they call it that good ole mountain dew and them that refuse it are fewI'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew Now Mr. Roosevelt told 'em just how he feltWhen he heard that the dry law 'd gone throughIf your liquors too red it'll swell up your headYou better stick to that good ole mountain dew [CHORUS] The preacher rode by with his head hasted highSaid his wife had been down with the fluHe thought that I o'rt to sell him a quart of my good ole mountain dew [CHORUS] Well my uncle Snort he's sawed off and short he measures four feet twoBut he feels like a giant when you give him a pint of that good old mountain dew [CHORUS]

In that dear old village churchyardI can see a mossy groundThat is where my mother's sleepingIn the cold and silent ground I was young but I rememberWhen the night my mother diedThere I saw her spirit fadingWhen she called me to her side Saying Darlin I must leave youAngels voices guide you homePray that we may meet in heaven When your mother's dead and gone Oft I wander to the churchyardFlowers to plant with tender careOn the grave of my dear motherDarkness finds me weeping there Looking at the stars above meWaitin for an early dawnThere by mother I'll be buriedAnd no more be left alone

I wandered again to my home in the mountains Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free I looked for my friends but I never could find them I found they were all rank strangers to me Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger No mother or dad not a friend could I see They knew not my name and I knew not their faces I found they were all rank strangers to me. Now they've all moved away said the voice of a stranger To a beautiful home by a bright crystal sea And some day I'll meet them all up in Heaven Where no one will be a rank stranger to me.
No matter what I say or doYou're never satisfiedI've tried I've tried so many timesSo I'm leaving you now goodbyeI'm riding on that midnight trainMy head is hanging lowThem awful blues will follow meWherever I may goWhy on earth was I ever bornI'll never understandTo fall in love with a woman like youIn love with another man
Can't you hear the night birds cryingCan't you hear the lonesome doveSaying, "Won't you come back, darlingTo the only one you love    Meet me out on the mountain   Underneath the lonesome pine   There we vowed we'd love each other   Darling, say won't you be mine Pretty mountain laurels bloomingPretty wildwood flowers growThere we vowed we'd love each otherIn our childhood long ago Then I left my little darlingLord, I wandered for too longMany nights I longed to see herNow I'm on my way back home
There's a story so unkind in the Holy book we findAnd it tells how Jesus stood alone one dayFalse accused and there condemned yet they found no fault with HimThe man who wore the scarlet purple robe     Purple robe my Savior wore oh the shame for me he bore   As He stood alone, forsaken on that day   And they placed upon His head piercing thorns and blood stained red   His raiment was a scarlet purple robe In the common judgment hall he was mocked and scorned by allAnd a tear of sorrow fell upon His cheekSoldiers of the wicked man smote Him with their evil handThe Man who wore the scarlet purple robe Words of truth that day were plain from the lips of Pilot cameIn this man I find no reason He should dieBut the multitudes replied let Him now be crucifiedThe man who wore the scarlet purple robe Oh the River Of Jordan is many miles awayAnd this mighty river I may never seeBut I'll find myself an alter in an old fashioned churchAnd my River Of Jordan that will be
The day I first met you my heart spoke to meThere is the angel you see in your dreamsAnd I know it must be for the way that I feelYour only a dream girl I know your not real    When you walked away my heart went with you   You stole it from me the day that we met   And now I must live my life in sorrow   No home just a drifter on the sea of regret The love that you promised to me on that dayIs now gone forever like the vows that you madeMy heart is so empty it's easy to tellLike a ship on the ocean I'm lost without sail
There'll be shouting on the hills of gloryShouting on the hills shouting on the hillsThere'll be shouting on the hills of gloryThere'll be shouting on the hills of GodOh what a blessed reunionOh what a blessed reunionWhen will we gather over yonderThere'll be shouting on the hills of GodNo more sorrow in that cityNo more sorrow in that cityJesus prepared a place in heavenThere'll be shouting on the hills of GodNow's the time to make your preparationsNow's the time to make your preparationsSo stop and make your reservationThere'll be shouting on the hills of God
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down   Sit down won't you sit down with the Lord and talk today   Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down   Sit down won't you sit down with the Lord today and pray My family and my friends I know mean a lotAnd I know who's the one who provides it allIt's Jesus from on high I can praise him til I dieI'm so glad I'll be with him when I die You won't always have this chance so gather while you canSome of you I know will let it passThere's sadness in my heart knowing we will have to partI'm so glad I'll be with him when I die
When we were young we played togetherThat's the way our love beganNow you're gone dear with another Now you're no more than just a friend    Sixteen years we were married    I remember the day that we were wed   Sixteen years is a mighty long time   Now you're gone I'm losin my mind Now the days are long and the nights are lonesomeIt seems like years have past and goneI didn't know you were unhappyI didn't know anything was wrong
Stone walls and steel bars a love on my mind   I'm a three time loser I'm long gone this time Jealousy has took my young lifeAll for the love of another man's wifeBut I've had it coming I've known all the timeNo more stone walls and steel bars and you on my mind Gray-haired warden deep Frisco BayGuards all around me leading my wayBut I've had it coming at the end of the lineNo more stone walls and steel bars and you on my mind
Just as far as I can rememberShe'll remain the rose of my heartMama fell sick along in DecemberFebruary brought us broken heartsThe reason we've not called a family reunionWe knew that she wouldn't be thereBut now that we've thought it all over MamaWe know you're spirit is hereOh no I can't forget the hours your the only one MommaAnd sweeter than the flowersOh no there's no use to botherTo speak of you now would only hurt FatherOh no momma we'll never forget youAnd someday we'll meet you up thereWe all gathered round and I stared at their facesAll heads were bowed mighty lowBut this was one time we all had to face itThough it hurt us so badly you knowWell it looked so good to see us togetherBut I had to look after dadOh no Mother when I passed by your casketI didn't want to remember you dead

Darlin do you really love me   Are you the girl I used to know   Something's happened to you darlin   But it pleases me to know Life is sweet when love is bloomingLike a wild rose on the hillBut when lovers part foreverWhere it ends no one can tell Many lonely nights I've travelledFar across this barren landThinking of that peaceful villageWhere we once strolled hand in hand When our journey here has endedAnd this life on earth is doneWe'll be sweethearts up in heavenFor me I know you are the one
Well, God spoke to Moses at the burning bushBurning bush, Lord the burning bushGod spoke to Moses at the burning bushSaying I am the Lord, thy God    Take your shoes off Moses you're on holy ground   Holy ground, you're on holy ground   Take your shoes off Moses you're on Holy ground   For I am the Lord, thy God Go yonder Moses and smite that rockSmite that rock, Lord smite that rockGo yonder Moses and smite that rockFor I am the Lord, thy God Stand still Moses see salvation workSalvation work, see salvation workStand still Moses and see salvation workFor I am the Lord, thy God
Many years now have passed since I saw my darling lastBut she waits alone there just for meI'll be going back some day and I never more will strayFrom that girl who stood by meI've about forgot the tune and the West Virginia moonBut the North Carolina moon is just as brightI'll never forget the time you promised to be mineThe moon was shining down that happy nightWhen I left her all alone in our little mountain homeI never thought of the day I'd returnNow I'm coming back to you love I know you've been trueWhat a price I've paid to live and learn
Sweetheart I recall the day I first met youI wonder if you remember the sameWe talked of the love we shared for each otherAnd longed for the day we'd change your sweet name    Oh, I can still hear your voice in the evening   I see your sweet face your blue eyes so bright   God took you away and left me so lonely   The angels are singing in heaven tonight As the years passed away we cherished each otherNo worries or cares to darken our dayFrom our little home up in the Clinch MountainsThe savior came down and called you one day I'll always be true and love you, my darlingBut I know you are happy and healthy up thereWhen God calls me home I'll meet you in heavenPlease wait for me, darling, I'll meet you up there
Listen poor sinner you're drifting awayFrom the dear Saviour who's pleading todayWhat will you do when the Saviour comes nighWhen the pale horse and his rider go by The time now ain't long when the Saviour will comeThen you'll be judged for the deeds you have doneOn that judgment day you'll weep and you'll cryWhen the pale horse and his rider go by Soften your heart and turn from all sinJesus is waiting to welcome you inThere's coming a time you'll wish He was nighWhen the pale horse and his rider go by Won't you redeem you poor wicked soulYou can't pay your way with silver and goldIf you're not saved you'll be lost in the nightWhen the pale horse and his rider go by
Is it true that I've lost youAm I not the only oneAfter all this pain and sorrowDarling think of what you've doneHeart to heart dear how I need youLike the flowers need the dewLoving you has been my life, dearI can't believe we're really throughI'll go back to old VirginiaWhere the mountains meet the skyIn those hills I learned to love youLet me stay there till I die
My heart is breaking and there's tears in my eyesThe heartaches you caused me has wrecked my young lifeThe love that you promised to me was untrueAll I have is a memory I can't forget about you This lonesome old feeling keeps hanging around meIt reminds me of you and the love that we knewI'll sit here alone there's no one beside meWith no love of my own now that you're gone The nights are so lonely and you're still on my mindI can't loose this memory of you now I findSo I'll go on hurting and thinking of youThis lonesome old feeling keeps making me blue
I wait for you dear all night longIt seems you never do get homeI fall asleep at the break of dayJust to drive these awful blues away Wake up sweetheart the night has passed You slept your troubles all awayGet ready now to love againThis weary heart you stole awayI heard you crying in your sleepYou said you found somebody newSo I'll live on and just pretendI could never love no one but youHow can you treat me like you doYou know I've never done you wrongMy heart will always worship youBut still each night I'm left alone
In a little country villageI met a man and he was blindAs I helped him cross the highway I cried thy burdens are greater than mineI can see the light of day And I need not feel my wayYes thy burdensSaw a lad well on his travels Trying hard to play the gameThough his leg was very crippled And he could not speak his nameStill he smiled in understanding Though life to him had been unkindAs I watched I thought in sorrow Son thy burdensI can speak my name aloud Make my way among the crowdYes thy burdensJust by chance I passed a graveyard Saw a young man kneeling thereIn his hand there were some roses On his lips there was a prayerOn a stone these words were written My soul is God's my memory thineAs I watched I thought in sorrow Friends thy burdensI'm just a drifter all alone I got no friends I got no home Yes thy burdens

Here's the story of two childhood sweetheartsAnd the love that you shared still untoldHow our simple little vows they were brokenAnd the love that I treasured more than gold Are you tired of the life that you're livingDoes your mind wander back to the pastDo your think of the love you've forsakenDarling true love is too sweet to last Alone in sadness I'm travelingI'm lost on the sea of regretWandering back to the place of my childhoodAnd the one I've always loved the best
Come pretty young girls give me your attentionTo these few lines I've tried to writeAbout a man who I won't mentionWho courted of his charming brideAnd when her parents came to know himThey tried so hard both day and nightTo separate here and her own true loverHer and her own true hearts delightShe turned her back upon the cityShe viewed the fields and meadows roundShe came upon a broad riverAnd in the shade of a tree sat downHer true love being not far behind He heard her make a mournful soundAnd looking on her lifeless body As she lay cold upon the groundHe then took out his silver weaponHe pierced it through his tender heartSayin let this be a dreadful warningFor all true lovers that have to part

While you are out beneath the moonlit skyI sit here and stare at the wallI think of you sweetheart and days gone byAnd I know two more years is all    Two more years is all and I'll be free   And then we can start our lives anew   I've held your memory so close to me   Two more years and I'll be free I've been in this old prison for nineteen yearsIt seems like ninety to meOnly twenty-four months of tears sweetheartTwo more years and I'll be free
Often my thoughts drift back to childhoodTo the times when I was freeAs I played before the fireside'Round my darling, mother's kneeThere's a blessed home up yonderWhere my loved ones wait for meI saw mother in a visionKneeling there to pray for meThen one day our mother left usDaddy said she'd gone to restI remember how she loved meAs she clutched me to her breastThere's a blessed home up yonderWhere my loved ones wait for meI saw mother in a visionKneeling there to pray for meSome sweet day I'll meet you, motherYour little boy is coming homeTo see you as in days of childhoodThe one you loved and left aloneThere's a blessed home up yonderWhere my loved ones wait for meI saw mother in a visionKneeling there to pray for me
We shall meet (we shall meet) where no storm clouds gatherWe shall meet (we shall meet) somedayBy the river of life sparkling cool and clearWe shall meet somedayHow our heart aches with grief when we say goodbyeWe shall meet (we shall meet) somedayWhere no sorrow or tears ever dims our eyesWe shall meet (we shall meet) somedayWhat a glorious thought as we say goodbyeWe shall meet (we shall meet) somedayIn that beautiful home that's prepared on highWe shall meet (we shall meet) someday
The days have seemed long and I've been so lonesomeRecalling those dreams that never came trueThe nights have been lonely but now that's all overAnd I've paid my debt for trusting in you    Every day your memory grows dimmer   The clouds drift away the sunshine peeks through   Every night no longer you haunt me   My conscience is clear dear what about you It's hard to believe that you are the same oneThat once meant so much to our love so trueIt's hard to know I've worshipped a false oneBut I've paid my debt dear what about you
I know that Jesus will never forsakeHis love will find a wayHe'll bridge the stream if his hand I will takeWhen he calls what can I sayDay follows night night follows dayFarther and farther I roamWhat will my answer be what can I sayWhen Jesus beckons my homeSometimes the clouds seem to cover his faceSometimes the skies are so grayStill by the stars and his wonderful graceHe'll roll the storm clouds away
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and blind as could be But my Savior in love gave me peace from above When he reached down his hand for me     When the Savior reached down for me    When he reached way down for me    I was lost and undone without God or his Son    When he reached down his hand for me  How my heart does rejoice when I hear his sweet voice In the tempest to him I can cling There to lean on his arm safe secure from all harm When he reached down his hand for me
When you go walking after midnight   Over on the wrong side of town   Walk down any street many lost souls you'll meet   Whose lives are broken like mine You'll find souls wandering out in darknessWhose place in life they'll never findWandering so aimless and hopelesslyWhose lives are broken like mine Thank God you've got a home to go toAnd a woman's love to keep you warmYou won't find the stars in the honky-tonk and bars Go home to your woman's loving arms
Sinner why not heed the day won't you come and go this wayWhere Jesus lives and we'll never say goodbyeTo a home that's far and bright and there never is a nightIn a land where we never shall die    I've a home way up on high where we shall live and never die   Won't you come and cross this river so wide   There with Jesus we will dwell never more to say farewell   In a land where we never shall die Walk the straight the narrow way fall down on your knees and prayGod will help you cross the mountaintop so highHe will take you by the hand lead you to that promised landIn a land where we never shall die
In the deep rolling hills of old VirginiaThere's a place that I love so wellWhere I spent many days of my childhoodIn the cabin where we loved to dwell White dove will mourn in sorrow The willows will hang their heads I'll live my life in sorrow Since mother and daddy are deadWe were all so happy there togetherIn our peaceful little mountain homeBut the Savior needs angels up in heavenNow they sing around the great white throneAs the years roll by I often wonderIf we will all be together somedayAnd each night as I wander through the graveyardDarkness finds me as I kneel to pray

In the beautiful hills way back in VirginiaBy the side of his home where he played as a ladIn a deep dark grave Carter lies sleepingThere lies the best friend that I ever had For twenty one years he travelled this countryEntertaining his friends wherever he roamedFor many thousands he made life brighterNow he is at rest near his old home He wrote many songs about the Clinch MountainsOf mother and dad his friends and homeThrough 43 states and many foreign countriesWherever he travelled his name was known Now he's at rest in the family graveyardOn top of a hill where the wind blows o'erHe's gone on now but he won't be forgottenThe songs he left will never grow old He laid down his guitar but he'll always be rememberedOn earth for the last time he sung white doveForever in heaven Carter will be singingSinging with the angels in heaven above
In this awful world of sorrowOn this wicked path of sinNever thinking of tomorrowOr what I'd lose in the end    Oh I can hear (oh I can hear) the joy bells ringing   Where my friends (where my friends) and loved ones wait   Oh I can hear the angels singing (sweet singing)   Just inside (just inside) those pearly gates I can hear my savior callingSaying come unto meWash away your sins foreverAnd you shall rest eternally Now I'm safe with my JesusHe will guide me on my wayI will sing His praise foreverWe'll meet in heaven some sweet day
As I went down for to take a little walkI came upon that Wild Bill JonesHe was a walking and a talking by my true lover's sideAnd I bid him to leave her aloneHe said my age is twenty-oneToo old to be controlledI pulled my revolver from my sideAnd I destroyed that poor boy's soulHe reeled and he staggered, and he fell to the groundAnd then he gave one dying moanHe wrapped his arms around my little girl's neckSaying honey won't you take me homeSo put them handcuffs on me boysAnd lead me to that freight car gateI have no friends or relations thereNo-one for to go my bailSo pass around that old long necked bottleAnd we'll all go on a spreeFor today was the last of that Wild Bill JonesAnd tomorrow will be the last of meThey sent me to prison for twenty long yearsThis poor boy longs to be freeBut Wild Bill Jones and that long-necked bottleHave been the ruin of me
On cruel Calvary where he suffered There he died upon the crossThat we might be saved my brother Freed from sin and not be lost Will he wait a little longer There's so many out in sin Will he wait a little longer Give us time to gather inA vision of that mangled bodyI can see his nail-scarred handsWhen He calls me way up yonderI will hear and understandMany loved ones gone before meThey've made their peace for the final dayBut should He call before they're readyI can almost him them say
I was standing by the windowOn a cold and cloudy dayWhen I saw the hearse come rollingTo carry my mother awayWill the circle be unbrokenBye and bye Lord bye and byeThere's a better home a waitingIn the sky Lord in the skyI said to the undertakerUndertaker please drive slowFor this lady you are carryingLord I hate to see her goWill the circle be unbrokenBye and bye Lord bye and byeThere's a better home a waitingIn the sky Lord in the skyWell I followed close behind herTried to hold up and be braveBut I could not hide my sorrowWhen they laid her in that grave Will the circle be unbrokenBye and bye Lord bye and byeThere's a better home a waitingIn the sky Lord in the skyI went back home that home was lonesomeSince my mother, she was goneAll my brothers and sisters cryingWhat a home so sad and alone
When these lips shall never morePlace a kiss upon thy browWhen life hold's still in deathWill you love me then as nowWill you miss me (miss me when I'm gone)Will you miss me (miss me when I'm gone)Will you miss me (miss me when I'm gone)Will you miss me when I'm gonePerhaps you'll plant some flowersRound my cold unworthy graveCome and sit along here beside meWhere the roses nod and waveOn a cold dark Sunday morningIn a land not far awayA little girl from old KentuckyLifted up her voice to say
A child was born to be our SaviorWise men came from near and farTo see the Jesus in the mangerThe pathway lighted by the starsSomeday he'll wake me from the deadNo more I'll sleep there all aloneBut carried up to Him on highOn the wings of angels headed homeThey crucified our Lord and SaviorHe humbly died there on the crossThat we might someday rise and join HimOur souls be saved and not be lost
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song   It takes a worried man to sing a worried song   It takes a worried man to sing a worried song   I'm worried now but I won't be worried long  I went across the river and I laid down to sleepI went across the river and I laid down to sleepI went across the river and I laid down to sleepWhen I woke up, there were shackles on my feet  Twenty one links of chain around my legTwenty one links of chain around my legTwenty one links of chain around my legAnd on each link, the initials of my name  I asked the judge what's gonna be my fineI asked the judge what's gonna be my fineI asked the judge what's gonna be my fineTwenty one years on the Rocky Mountain Line  If anyone should ask you who composed this songIf anyone should ask you who composed this songIf anyone should ask you who composed this songSay it was me and I sing it all day long
You go to your church and I'll go to mineBut let's walk along togetherOur fathers built them side by sideSo let's walk along together    The road is rough and the way is long   But we'll help each other over   You go to your church and I'll go to mine   But let's walk along together You go to your church and I'll go to mineBut let's walk along togetherOur Heavenly Father is the sameSo let's walk along together The Lord will be at your church todayBut he'll be at my church alsoYou go to your church and I'll go to mineBut let's walk along together
People keep asking and wondering whyThere's always a tear in your eyeYou've lived a hard life one I'd rather not leadI ought to be glad it's not me    But when tears fill your eyes and clouds hide the sky   Your heart is so sad and you have a worried mind   You'll know my heart is with you and my love for you ain't blind   Your worries and troubles are mine Now the nights are hard to get through as I wait restlesslyMy letters are written in vainUnsure of your feelings my tears fall endlesslyAnd my heart's beating rhythm with the rain
There waits for me a glad tomorrow,Where gates of pearl swing open wide,And when I've passed this vale of sorrow, I'll dwell upon the other side. Some day beyond the reach of mortal ken,Some day God only knows just where and whenThe wheels of mortal life shall all stand stillAnd I shall go to dwell on Zion's hill. Some day I'll hear the angels singing,Beyond the shadows of the tomb;And all the bells of heaven ringing,While saints are singing, "Home, sweet home." Some day my labors will be ended,And all my wand'rings will be o'er,And all earth's broken ties be mended, And I shall sigh and weep no more. Some day the dark clouds will be rifted,And all the night of gloom be past;And all life's burdens will be lifted,The day of rest shall dawn at last.
