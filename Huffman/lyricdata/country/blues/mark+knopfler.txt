5.15 A.M. Snow laying all around A collier cycles homeFrom his night shift undergroundPast the silent pubPrimary school, workingmen's club On the road from the pithead The churchyard packed With mining deadThen beneath the bridge He comes to a giant car A shroud of snow upon the roofA mark ten jaguarHe thought the man was fast asleepSilent, still and deepBoth dead and coldShot through With bullet holesThe one armed bandit manCame north to fill his bootsCame up from cockneyland E-type jags and flashy suitsPut your money in Pull the leversWatch them spinCash cows in all the pubsBut he preferred the new nightclubsNineteen sixty-sevenBandit men in birdcage heaven La dolce vita, sixty-nineAll new to people of the TyneWho knows who did what Somebody made a callThey said his hands Were in the potThat he'd been skimming haulsHe picks up the swagThey gaily gave awayDrives his giant jag Off to his big pay dayThe bandit manCame north to fill his bootsCame up from cockneyland E-type jags and flashy suitsThe bandit manCame up the great north roadUp to geordielandTo mine The mother lodeSeams blew up or crackedBlack diamonds came hard wonGenerations toiled and hacked For a pittance and black lungCrushed by tub or stoneTogether And aloneHow the young and old Paid the price of coalEighteen sixty-sevenMy angel's gone to heavenHe'll be happy thereSunlight and sweet clean airThey gather round the glass Tough hewers and cruttersChild trappers and puttersThe little foals and half-marrowsWho pushed And pulled the barrowsThe hod boys And the rolleywaymen 5.15 A.M.

My lady may I have this danceForgive a knight who knows no shameMy lady may I have this danceAnd lady may I have your nameYou danced upon a soldier's armAnd I felt the blade of love so keenAnd when you smiled you did me harmAnd I was drawn to you, my Queen Now these boots may take me where they willThough they may never shine like hisThere is no knight I would not killTo have my lady's hand to kissYes and they did take me through the hallTo leave me not one breath from youAnd they fell silent one and allAnd you could see my heart was true Then I did lead you from the hallAnd we did ride upon the hillAway beyond the city wallAnd sure you are my lady stillA night in summer long agoThe stars were falling from the skyAnd still, my heart, I have to knowWhy do you love me, lady, why?
This empty kitchen's whereI'd while away the hoursJust next to my old chairYou'd usually have some flowersThe shelves of booksEven the picture hooksEverything is goneBut my heart is hanging onIf this old neighborhoodSurvived us both alrightDon't know that it withstoodAll the things that took our lightYou on the stairI can see you thereEverything is goneBut my heart is hanging onOnce there was a little girlUsed to wonder what she would beWent out into the big wide worldNow she's just a memoryThere used to be a little school hereWhere I learned to write my nameBut time has been a little cruel hereTime has no shameIt's just a place whereWe used to liveIt's just a place whereWe used to liveNow in another townYou lead another lifeAnd now upstairs and downYou're someone else's wifeHere in the dustThere's not a trace of usEverything is goneBut my heart is hanging onIt's just a place whereWe used to liveIt's just a place whereWe used to live

Sweet surrender on the quaysideYou remember we used to run and hideIn the shadow of the cargoes I take you one timeAnd we're counting all the numbers down to the waterlineNear misses on the dogleap stairwaysFrench kisses in the darkened doorwaysA foghorn blowing out wild and coldA policeman shines a light upon my shoulderUp comes a coaster fast and silent in the nightOver my shoulder all you can see are the pilot lightsNo money in our jackets and our jeans are tornYour hands are cold but your lips are warmShe can see him on the jetty where they used to goShe can feel him in the places where the sailors goWhen she's walking by the river and the railway lineShe can still hear him whisperLet's go down to the waterline

Are you home from the sea, my soul balladeerYou've been away roamin' far away from hereWeathered a storm, your heart unafraidCrossed every ocean in the boat that you madeBeen blowin' your horn, scarin' the spooksNo crotchets or quavers in your booksGone sailin' all night, straight in the veinLike a bird on his own flight in his domainIn the skyIn the skyRunnin' in on the tide with the first of the starsThe moon on the water and the sound of guitarsGlide into the homin' as the night fallsTie up in the haven by the old harbor wallAnd the hard-bitten stranger, deaf as a postWho stands at the fire where a poet's dreams roastHe can't know the story, he can't feel the painAnd all of the glory falls around him like rainIn the skyIn the skyyou're a light in the dark, beacon of hopeAnd strong as a sea boat, strong as a ropeAnd the vagabond wind whispers over the bayAnd the songs and the laughter are carried awayIn the skyIn the skyIn the skyIn the sky

You walk out on the high wireYou're a dancer on thin iceYou pay no heed to the dangerAnd less to adviceYour footsteps are forbiddenBut with knowledge of your sinYou throw your love to all the strangersAnd caution to the windAnd you go dancing through doorwaysJust to see what you will findLeaving nothing to interfereWith the crazy balance of your mindAnd when you finally reappearAt the place where you came inYou've thrown your love to all the strangersAnd caution to the windIt takes love over goldAnd mind over matterTo do what you do that you mustWhen the things that you holdCan fall and be shatteredOr run through your fingers like dust

Storybook LoveWritten and sung by Willy DeVille,Arranged by Mark Knopfler,Engineered and mixed by Steve JacksonCome my love, I'll tell you a taleOf a boy and girl and their love storyAnd how he loved her oh, so much,And all the charms she did possess.Now this did happen once upon a timeWhen things were not so complex.And how he worshipped the ground she walked on.When he looked in her eyes, he became obsessed.(To Chorus:)Chorus:My love is like a storybook story.But it's as real as the feelings I feel.My love is like a storybook story.But it's as real as the feelings I feel;It's as real as the feelings I feelThis love was stronger than the powers so dark,A prince could have within his keeping;His spells to weave and steal a heartWithin her breast, but only sleeping.(To Chorus:)He said, "Don't you know I love you oh, so much,And lay my heart at the foot of your dress?"She said, "Don't you know that storybook lovesAlways have a happy ending?"Then he swooped her up, just like in the books,And on his stallion they rode away.(To Chorus:)

JoeAnd I'd blown off almost everyone when my motor let goNew England, Ontario we died in the dirtThose walls from mid-Ohio to Toronto they hurtSo we came to Road America where we burned up at the lakeBut at the speedway at Nazareth I made no mistake

You get a shiver in the darkIt's raining in the park but meantimeSouth of the river you stop and you hold everythingA band is blowing Dixie double four timeYou feel alright when you hear that music ringYou step inside but you don't see too many facesComing in out of the rain to hear the jazz go downToo much competition too many other placesBut not too many horns can make that soundWay on downsouth way on downsouth London townYou check out Guitar George he knows all the chordsMind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or singAnd an old guitar is all he can affordWhen he gets up under the lights to play his thingAnd Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the sceneHe's got a daytime job he's doing alrightHe can play honky tonk just like anythingSaving it up for Friday nightWith the Sultans with the Sultans of SwingAnd a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the cornerDrunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform solesThey don't give a damn about any trumpet playing bandIt ain't what they call rock and rollAnd the Sultans played CreoleAnd then the man he steps right up to the microphoneAnd says at last just as the time bell rings'Thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'And he makes it fast with one more thing'We are the Sultans of Swing'

A long time ago came a man on a trackWalking thirty miles with a sack on his backAnd he put down his load where he thought it was the bestHe made a home in the wildernessHe built a cabin and a winter storeAnd he ploughed up the ground by the cold lake shoreAnd the other travellers came riding down the trackAnd they never went further and they never went backThen came the churches then came the schoolsThen came the lawyers then came the rulesThen came the trains and the trucks with their loadsAnd the dirty old track was the telegraph roadThen came the mines - then came the oreThen there was the hard times then there was a warTelegraph sang a song about the world outsideTelegraph road got so deep and so wideLike a rolling riverAnd my radio says tonight it's gonna freezePeople driving home from the factoriesThere's six lanes of trafficThree lanes moving slowI used to like to go to work but they shut it downI've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be foundYes and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owedWe're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowedAnd the birds up on the wires and the telegraph polesThey can always fly away from this rain and this coldYou can hear them singing out their telegraph codeAll the way down the telegraph roadYou know I'd sooner forget but I remember those nightsWhen life was just a bet on a race between the lightsYou had your head on my shoulder you had your hand in my hairNow you act a little colder like you don't seem to careBut believe in me baby and I'll take you awayFrom out of this darkness and into the dayFrom these rivers of headlights these rivers of rainFrom the anger that lives on the streets with these names'cause I've run every red light on memory laneI've seen desperation explode into flamesAnd I don't want to see it againFrom all of these signs saying sorry but we're closedAll the way down the telegraph road

In summer '63 I was staying aliveHanging at the races, hoping to driveWhen they were done with the weekend and loading the carsI couldn't get a pass so I went to the barI'm up in the corner nursing a beerWho should come laughing and joking in hereBut Bobby Borwn, the winer of the sports car raceWith some friends and a girl, man, she lit up the placeBobby was a wild boy, one summerHe knocked down a motel wall with a hammerHe'd do anything, one night for a betHe raced through the cornfields in a CorvetteI thought it's got to be a thrill to be like thatWith the beautiful girl and be king of the trackBut the truth is when all was said and doneIt was his Cobra I wanted, the car was the oneIt was his Cobra I wanted, the car was the oneThe car was the one, the car was the one

It gets so dark before the dawnThat's when it gets to meBefore the city symphony of taxi horns That's the way it always starts,Sitting here and waiting on the beating of my heart. Last night I thought I heard my nameWell it was too dark to see, but it had to be,The voice was just the same That's the way it always starts,Sitting here and waiting on the beating of my heart. So tell me why should it have to be this wayWhy can't it be all right,Why can't I sleep at night?Why should it have to be this way?Why must there be this price to pay? Now all the streets are dark and bare,Oh, if you can live in this town,And stick around, you can live anywhere That's the way it always starts,Sitting here and waiting on the beating of my heart.

Oh, the summer time is comingAnd the trees are blooming, And the wild mountain thyme Grows around the blooming heather. Will you go, lassie, will you go? And we'll all go together To pull wild mountain thyme All around the blooming heather, Will you go, lassie, go? I will build my love a bower By yon clear and crystal fountain, And all around the bower,I'll pile flowers from the mountain. If my true love, she won't have me, I will surely find another To pull wild mountain thyme All around the blooming heather. Oh, the summertime is coming And the trees are blooming And the wild mountain thyme Grows around the blooming heather

You Look BeautifulYou're looking good,I Haven't seen you for a long time,How've you been? I like the way you have your hair,But something has changed,And I can see a woman in your eyes, and in your smile;Remember when we'd always be together,And we believed this love would never die.And ever since then,I've often wondered how I'd feel if we should meet again,And you look beautiful, you look wonderful,You're like an angel heaven sent to me,You look beautiful, you look wonderful,I've got a feeling this was meant to be,When we broke apart, we both set off to find the world,And face the storms of life,I thought I heard you calling,When your ship hit the rocks,And here we are survivors from the seaJust you and me, out on the beach,If you have time,Lets get a cup of coffee, and talk about,All the feelings that we share,Cos when there's still love,You know it from the moment that you see,Those eyes again;And you look beautiful,You look wonderful,You're like an angel heaven sent to me,You look beautiful,You look wonderful,I've got a feeling this was meant to be,Yes I know it this was meant to be,You look wonderful,Now I know it, this was meant to be;
All the late night bargains have been struckBetween the satin beaus and their bellesAnd prehistoric garbage trucksHave the city to themselvesEchoes roars dinosaursThey're all doing the monster mashAnd most of the taxis and the whoresAre only taking calls for cashI don't know how it happenedIt all took place so quickBut all I can do is hand it to youAnd your latest trickMy door was standing openSecurity was laid back and laxBut it was only my heart got brokenYou must have had a pass key made out of waxYou played robbery with insolenceAnd I played the blues in twelve bars down Lover's LaneAnd you never did have the intelligence to useThe twelve keys hanging off my chainI don't know how it happenedIt all took place so quickBut all I can do is hand it to youAnd your latest trickNow it's past last call for alcoholPast recall has been here and goneThe landlord finally paid us allThe satin jazzmen have put away their hornsAnd we're standing outside of this wonderlandLooking so bereaved and so bereftLike a Bowery bum when he finally understandsThe bottle's empty and there's nothing leftI don't know how it happenedIt was faster than the eye could flickBut now all I can do is hand it to youAnd your latest trick
There's nothing I can doNothing I can sayYou'll do what you want toYou'll go your own sweet wayYou'll go your own sweetYour own sweet wayYou'll go your own sweetYour own sweet wayNow I can talk to you seriousI can talk to you niceBut when it comes to loveYou won't take good adviceYou'll go your own sweetYour own sweet wayYou'll go your own sweetYour own sweet wayIt doesn't matter what I sayWhat I do or what I thinkYou can lead a horse to waterYou can't make him drinkYou'll go your own sweetYour own sweet wayYou'll go your own sweetYour own sweet way
