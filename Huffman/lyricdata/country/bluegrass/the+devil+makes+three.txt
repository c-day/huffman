I guess I grew up on an old dirt road Pedal to the metal always did what I was toldTill I found out that my brand new clothes Came second hand from the rich kids next doorWell, I grew up fast, I guess I grew up meanThere's a thousand things inside my head I wish I ain't seenAnd now I just wandered through a real bad dreamFeelin' like I'm coming apart at the seams Thank you Jack Daniels, Old Number Seven, Tennessee Whiskey got me drinking in heavenAngels start to look good to meThey're gonna have to deport me to the fiery deep Thank you Jack Daniels Old Number SevenTennessee Whiskey got me drinking in heavenI know I can't stay here too long Cause I can't go a week with out doin' wrongWithout doing wrongWithout doing wrongWithout doing wrong So I'm sitting as the bar stool it starts to grow roots Feelin' like an old worn out pair of shoesTell me what is it I should do When I'm swimming in the liquor only half way throughSo I'm watching as his wings spread as wide as could beCome on now and wrap them around meCause all I want to do now is fall to sleepCome down here and lay next to me  Thank you Jack Daniels Old Number SevenTennessee Whiskey got me drinking in heavenUp here the bottle never runs dry And you never wake up with those tears in your eyes Thank you Jack Daniels Old Number SevenTennessee Whiskey got me drinking in heavenAngels start to look good to meThey're gonna have to deport me to the fiery deep(Old Number Seven)To the fiery deep (Drinkin' in heaven)To the fiery deep (Old Number Seven)To the fiery deep (Drinkin' in heaven)
Your mumblin words that I can't hear any moreYour totally entertained but I am absolutely boredTo the sharks with your conversations see what they sayYour thrown over bored and disappear into the waves Down to Neptune's kingdom in the ink-black drinkOctopus bartenders, you can hear the mermaids singThat'll teach you all to try and disobeyHeres a one way ticket to your watery grave And we sayTo all our enemies, we'll see you in hellWe're gonna walk'em off the plank into the wishing wellDown to Davey Jones' locker where the fishes sleepWon't be prayin for you, so don't be prayin for me, oh To all our enemies, we'll see you in hellWe're gonna walk'em off the plank into the wishing wellDown to Davey Jones' locker where the fishes sleepWon't be praying for you, so don't be prayin, don't be prayin for me Kill all the prisoners till their skin turns greenLet the salts of the ocean wash their skeletons cleanRaise up the oars and let them fallAs the wind steady sings you can hear the crew call, oh To all our enemies, we'll see you in hellWe're gonna walk'em off the plank into the wishing wellDown to Davey Jones' locker where the fishes sleepWon't be prayin for you, so don't be prayin for me, oh To all our enemies, we'll see you in hellWe're gonna walk'em off the plank into the wishing wellDown to Davey Jones' locker where the fishes sleepWon't be prayin for you, so don't be prayin, don't be prayin for me
