I thought I'd seen pretty girls in my timeThat was before I met youI never saw one that I wanted for mineThat was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tailI thought I could never be blueI thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been lovedBut that was before I met you I wanted to ramble and always be freeThat was before I met youI said that no woman could ever hold meThat was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tailI thought I could never be blueI thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been lovedBut that was before I met you They tell me I must reap just what I have sownDarlin', I hope it's not trueFor once I made plans of living aloneBut that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tailI thought I could never be blueI thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been lovedBut that was before I met you

At every glance, you steal from meI catch your eyes still offeringYou've got desire bought with deceit'Cause borrowed love ain't never free I vainly swear in my starved mindTo crave your look only one more timeAnd pray not to reap what we might sowIf borrowed love should start to grow Borrowed love, not yours for givin'Borrowed love, not mine to seekBorrowed love, this road we're takin'Toward one another's awful steep Forgiveness for what passion wreaksBears a hurtful cost that don't come cheapIt's wages paid with misery'Cause borrowed love ain't never free Borrowed love, not yours for givin'Borrowed love, not mine to seekBorrowed love, this road we're takin'Toward one another's awful steep At every glance, you steal from meI catch your eyes still offeringL got desire bought with deceit'Cause borrowed love ain't never free
There's a happy childhood home in my memory I can seeStanding out upon the hill 'neath the shadow of the treeIf I only had my way it would give my heart a thrillJust to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill.Oh I want to wander back to the cabin on the hill'Neath the shadow of the tree I would like to linger stillJust to be with those I love joy my heart would over fillJust to simply wander back to the cabin on the hillBut the saddest of it all I can never more returnTo that happy childhood home matters not how much I yearnIf I only had my way it would give my heart a thrillJust to simply wander back to the cabin on the hill 
Soon the pines will be falling everywhereVillage children fight each other for a shareAnd the 6:09 goes roaring past the creekDeacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week I saw grandma yesterday down at the storeWell she's really going fine for eighty fourWell she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barnPoor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm And it's good old country comfort in my bonesJust the sweetest sound my ears have ever knownJust an old-fashioned feeling fully-grownCountry comfort's in a truck that's going home Down at the well they've got a new machineThe foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteenYeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would sayYou see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticksThe hedgehog's done in clay between the bricksAnd the rocking chair's creaking on the porchAcross the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

Sometimes I feel like an innocent oneTo deserve this fate what I have I ever doneI know that I made all the rulesBut time can even change the hopeless ways of foolsI love you tonight like I did yesterdayI won't think of tomorrow or the price I payI drink from the well my soul is dryI never know why All I want is for your love to be all mineBut the angels won't have itAll I want is just a little peace of mindBut the angels won't have itI thought I had a piece of my soul left to sellI guess it's just as well'Cause the angels won't have it Who's looking after this see-through heartSomeone up there isn't doing their partOh Cupid you foolish boyYou should take better aim with your brand new toyI love you tonight like I did yesterdayI don't think of tomorrow or the price I payI drink from the well my soul is dryI never know why All I want is for your love to be all mineBut the angels won't have itAll I want is just a little peace of mindBut the angels won't have itI thought I had a piece of my soul left to sellI guess it's just as well'Cause the angels won't have it So if I die before I wakeThe innocent one whose heart could never breakLift me up take me out of this bedWatching the angels shake their headsDon't feel sorry for me baby honey don't you cryYou can sell all of my clothes you will forget me by and byI'll be riding that train I'll be singing that songBut I won't be gone for long'Cause the angels won't have it All I want is for your love to be all mineBut the angels won't have itAll I want is just a little peace of mindBut the angels won't have itI thought I had a piece of my soul left to sellI guess it's just as well'Cause the angels won't have it

From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shoreGreen old flowing mountains to the southbell by the shoreMighty tall and handsome and known quite well by allShe's a combination on the Wabash Cannonball Now she came down from Birmingham one cold December dayAs she pulled into the station you could hear all the people sayThere's a gal from Tennessee, she's long and she's tallShe came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball Our eastern states are dandy, so the people always sayFrom New York to St Louis and Chicago by the wayFrom the hills of Minnesota, where the rippling waters fallNo changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball Now listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roarGlides along the woodland, through the hills and by the shoreHear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hoboes callTravelin' through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
