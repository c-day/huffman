You want me to love just you While you love your shareDon't you think that's a little unfairIt's me that stays home While you stay gone Till you decide to careDon't you think that's a little unfairI can't see how it can be anything for meWhat's mine is yours What's yours is yours That's how you wanted to beAnd you want me to wait for you Till you decide to careDon't you think that's a little unfairI can't see how it can be anything for meWhat's mine is yours What's yours is yours That's how you wanted to beAnd you want me to wait for you Till you decide to careDon't you think that's a little unfair
Twilight falls, evenin' shadows findThere, 'neath the stars, a maiden, so fair, divineLonely there, she kneels and tells the stars aboveIn her heart is a song and there it belongsHer undying song of love Every word reveals an empty broken heartBroken by fate that held them so far apartStars on high seem to know she's thereIn her heart is a song and there it belongsHer undying song of love
Yesterday, as I talked with a friend in town,I forgot to remember that you'd gone.For a moment, I found myself smiling,But a moment isn't very long. An' last night as I danced with a stranger,An' she held her cheek close to my own,For a moment, I almost forgot you,But a moment isn't very long. Every now an' then I get a chance to smile,But those every now an' thens just last a little while.An' tonight I've got a date with a new love,But I know I'd do just as well at home.For a moment, maybe I could forget you.But a moment isn't very long. Every now an' then I get a chance to smile,But those every now an' thens just last a little while.An' tonight I've got a date with a new love,But I know I'd do just as well at home.For a moment, maybe I could forget you.But a moment isn't very long.
All my tears have fallen, I can cry no more.I've cried so mmuch since you have said goodbye.The pressure keeps on building up, within my heart.It grows and grows but still, my eyes are dry.Though my heart is breakin', tears refuse to start,So I've got to find a new way to cry.I've got to find a new way to relieve the pain.It just can't stay, forever, locked inside.And until I forget you and can smile again,I've got to find a new way to cry.[Instrumental break]I've got to find a new way to relieve the pain.It just can't stay, forever, locked inside.And until I forget you and can smile again,I've got to find a new way to cry.
I've been so many places in my life and timeI've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymeI've acted out my life in stagesWith ten thousand people watchingBut we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for youI know your image of me is what I hope to be, babyI've treated you unkindly but girl can't you seeThere's no one more important to meSo darling can't you please see through me'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for youYou taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'You came out in front and I was hidingBut now I'm so much better so if my words don't come togetherListen to the melody cause my love's in there hidingI love you in a place where there's no space or timeI love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mineAnd when my life is over, remember when we were togetherWe were alone and I was singin' my song for youI love you in a place where there's no space or timeI've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mineAnd when my life is over, remember when we were togetherWe were alone and I was singin' my song for you, yesWe were alone and I was singin' this song for you, babyWe were alone and I was singin' my song,Singin' my song, singin' my song, singin' my songSingin' my song

There's a land where I've been told every street is paved with goldAnd it's just across the borderlineWhen it's time to take your turn here's a lesson that you must learnYou could lose more than you'll ever findWhen you reach the broken promiseland every dream slips through your handYou'll know it's too late to change your mind'Cause you paid the price to come so far just to wind up where you areAnd you're still just across the borderlineUp and down the Rio Grande a thousand footprints in the sandReveal the secret no one can defineThe river flows on like a breath in between our life and deathWho's the next to cross the borderlineHope remains when pride is gone and it keeps you moving onCalling you across the borderlineWhen you reach the broken promiseland...And you're still just across the borderline

Are there any more real cowboysLeft out in these hills?Will the fire hit the ironOne more time?And will one more dusty pick-upComing rolling down the roadWith a load of feed before the sun gets high?Well, I hope that working cowboy never dies.Not the one that's snortin' cocaineWhen the honky-tonk's all closedBut the one that prays for more rainHeaven knowsThat the good feed brings the moneyAnd the money buys the clothesNot the diamond sequins shining on TVBut the kind the working cowboy really needs.Are there any more country familiesStill working hand in handTrying hard to stay togetherAnd make a stand?While the rows and rows of housesCome creepin' up on the landWhere the cattle graze and an old grey barn still standsAre there any more real cowboys in this land?Are there any more real cowboys in this land?

You didn't know I wasn't free when you fell in love with meAnd with all your young heart you learned to careIt brought you shame and disgrace, the world has tumbled in your placeBecause they call our love a back street affairThey say you wrecked my home, I'm a husband that's gone wrongThey don't know the sorrow that we've had to bearFor the one that I'm tied to was the first to be untrueAnd yet they call our love a back street affairWe have each other now, that's all that matters anyhowWhy the judgment of gossip's never fairWe'll just be brave and strong, then someday they'll see they're wrongSo let them call our love a back street affairWe'll be free to love someday when all the talk has died awayAnd the happiness we've hoped for then we'll shareI'll climb a mountain high and the world will hear me cryThat our love is not a back street affair
I guess my heart has settled back to Earth.I rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth.But true love is both a blessing and a curse.Today my heart just settled back to Earth.Now I know just how you felt that night so long ago.But the dream for you had ended and you let me know.So I bounced from sky to sky,Tryin' to keep the dream alive.But everything I did just made it worse.Guess my heart just settled back to Earth.Love created songs that I still sing.Love we knew still makes the rafters ?red?.Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.Songs our love created I still sing.Love we knew still makes the rafters ?red?.Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.Our song will never have a final verse,Our hearts just finally settled back to Earth

Way down in Louisiana amongst the tall grown sugar canesLived a simple man and a domineerin' hen and a rose of a different nameThe first time I fell lightly I was standing in the drizzlin' rainWith a trembling hand and a bottle of gin and a rose of a different nameThe devil made me do it the first time the second time I done it on my ownLord put a handle on a simple handed man and help me leave that black rose aloneWhen the devil made that woman Lord she threw the pattern awayShe was built for speed with the tools you need to make a new fool every dayWay down deep and dirty on the darker side of shameYou caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin with a rose of a different nameThe devil made me do it the first timeThe devil made me do it the first time
I was sittin' beside the road in Blackjack CountyNot knowing that the sheriff paid a bountyFor men like me who didn't have a penny to their namesSo he locked my leg to thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chainAll we had to eat was bread and waterEach day we had to build that road a mile and a quarterBlack sneak whip would cut our backs when some poor fool complainedBut we couldn't fight back wearin' 35 pounds of Blackjack County chainAnd then one night while the sheriff was a sleepin'We all gathered round him slowly creepin'And heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rainWhen we beat him death with thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chainNow the whip marks have all healed and I am thankfulThat there's nothing but a scar round my ankleMost of all I'm glad no man will be a slave againTo a black sneak whip and thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chainTo a black sneak whip and thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chain
As you sit there in your loneliness,Confused as you must be.I'm sure a dozen questions come to mind.And if you're wondering why I left you,After all you've done for me,I guess you'll have to blame it on the times. The many times you had your way,No matter what the cost.And the many times you took for granted,Love you now have lost.And if I've hurt you, darling,I don't mean to be unkind.I guess you'll have to blame it on the times. That small conceited world of yours,Could never understand,That to want to stand alone is not a crime.And, if for one time in my life,I'm acting like a man,I guess you'll have to blame it on the times. Blame it on the many times,A hiding place I'd seek.Afraid to say what's on my mind,An' ashamed for being weak.So if at last I'm seeing,After so long being blind,I suppose you'll have to blame it on the times.

In the twilight glow I see herBlue eyes crying in the rainWhen we kissed goodbye and partedI knew we'd never meet againLove is like a dying emberAnd only memories remainAnd through the ages I'll rememberBlue eyes crying in the rainSome day when we meet up yonderWe'll stroll hand in hand againIn a land that knows no partingBlue eyes crying in the rain
I'd like to say that I triedIt fits in with all the suggestions and lies and empty tablesWith food untouched,I couldn't see the future.I liked the past too muchI've been going door to door like I got something to sell,Wandering like a foolThrough the halls of a blue hotel.So go on and rain down on usGo on and rainGo on and rain down on usI give up, I give up.Something about her that's cold.She's blowing through the trees,Leaving me rawAs the words come out,I get confused.I get shattered like a light bulb in an October moon.She's inside me like a secretAnd I got no one to tell.Wandering like a foolThrough the halls of a blue hotel.Go on and rain down on usGo on and rainGo on and rain down on usI give up.I give up.
Well, he rode into Blue Rock, dusty an' tired,An' got him a room for the night.He lay there in silence with too much on his mind.Still hopin' that he was not right.But he found them that evenin' at a tavern in town,In a quiet little out of the way place.An' they smiled at each other when he walked through the door.An' they died with their smiles on their faces.They died with their smile on their face.
Well, he rode into Blue Rock, dusty an' tired,And got him a room for the night.He lay there in silence with too much on his mind.Still hoping that he was not right.But he found them that evening at a tavern in town,In a quiet little out of the way place.And they smiled at each other when he walked through the door.And they died with their smiles on their faces.They died with their smile on their face.Red Headed Stranger.Don't boss him, don't cross him.He's wild in his sorrow,He's riding an' hiding his pain.Don't fight him, don't spite him,Just wait till tomorrow,Maybe he'll ride on again.

Met a girl that I loved In a town way down in Texas'Neath the stars up above She was the sweetest girl I ever did seeSo I held her in my arms And told her of her many charmsAnd I kissed her While the fiddles played The 'Bonaparte's Retreat'And all the world was bright As I held her on that nightAnd I heard her say Don't you ever go awaySo I held her in my arms And told her of her many charmsAnd I kissed her While the guitars played The 'Bonaparte's Retreat'All the world was bright As I held her on that nightAnd I heard her say Don't you ever go awaySo I held her in my arms And told her of her many charmsAnd I kissed her While the guitars played The 'Bonaparte's Retreat'
I'm born to lose I've lived my life in vain Every dreamHas only brought me painAll my life I've always been so blue Born to lose And now I'm losing youBorn to lose It seems so hard to bear How I long To always have you nearYou've grown tired And now you say we're through Born to lose And now I'm losing youI'm born to lose My every hope is gone It's so hard to face An empty dawnAnd you were all The happiness I knew I'm born to lose And now I'm losing you
I've been trying so hard to forget youBut this chore of forgetting I findHas me burning both ends of the candleAnd fighting a battle with timeWhat I'd give just to sleep for a momentBut it's a luxury that I can't affordFor I know that I just dream about youAnd my tears would start falling once moreSo I'm burning both ends of the candleI just hope that it lasts through the nightFor each moment the candle is burningBrings closer the ending of lifeSo I'm burning both ends of the candleI just hope that it lasts through the nightFor each moment the candle is burningIt brings closer the ending of life
Bows and flows of angel hair Ice cream castles in the airAnd feathered canyons everywhere I'd look at clouds that wayNow they only block the sun They rain and snow on everyoneSo many things I could have done The clouds got in my wayI've looked at clouds from both sides now From up and down and still somehowIt's cloud's illusions I recall I really don't know cloud at allMoons and Junes and Ferris Wheels Dizzy dancing way you feelAs every fairy tale complete I'd look at love that wayBut now it's just another show You leave 'em laughin' when you goAnd if you care don't let them know Don't give yourself awayI've looked at love from both sides now From up and down and still somehowIt's love's illusions I recall I really don't know love at all
My troubled old heart dear is beating with pain,You've gone and I know I'm the one who's to blame,You've gone in the world to make a new start,And left as a memory your brand on my heart.They say you were crying while packing your thingsAnd left me your locket and bright golden rings,The plans for your future I've broken apartNow all I have left is your brand on my heart.You say you were sorry it ended this wayAnd that I'll find someone to love me someday,Another to cherish the love you once knew,But darling that someone can only be you.The flowers you planted, that rose you loved bestIt's soft velvet petals are now closed in deathThe birds have hushed singing, it all plays a partTo deepen the wound of your brand on my heart.I'm appealing to you for forgiveness todayFor all of your tears darling I've had to pay,If you'll just forgive me we'll make a new startAnd no more will I carry your brand on my heart.
When you're weary and feeling smallWhen tears are in your eyes I will dry them allI'm on your side when times get rough and friends just can't be foundLike a bridge over troubled water I will lay me downWhen you're down and out when you're on the streetWhen evening falls so hard I will comfort youI'll take your part when darkness comes and pain is all aroundLike a bridge over troubled water I will lay me downLike a bridge over troubled water I will lay me downSail on silver girl sail on byYour time has come to shine all your dreams're on their waySee how they shine if you need a friend I'm sailing right behindLike a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mindLike a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mindI will ease your mind

I made myself a promise, the day you put me down,That I wouldn't see you if you came around.But here you are, within my arms, the way you used to be.And I broke the promise that I made to me.They told me you were at a dance and I prepared to go:I made myself a promise that I'd only say hello.I knew you'd only hurt me, but it's such sweet misery,So I broke the promise that I made to me.A broken promise always means someone will surely cry,And I know who that someone's bound to be.And tomorrow I'll be sorry that I told myself a lie,And broke the promise that I made to me. A broken promise always means someone will surely cry,And I know who that someone's bound to be.And tomorrow I'll be sorry that I told myself a lie,And broke the promise that I made to me.
Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting apart from The laughter and the cheerScenes from the past Rise before me while Watching the bubbles in my beerVisions of someone Who loved me brings Along salty tears to my eyesAnd I know that my life's Been a failure Watching the bubbles in my beerI'm seeing the road That I've traveled A road paved With heartaches and tearsAnd I'm seeing the past That I've wasted Watching the bubbles in my beerVisions of someone who loved me...

Today, I passed you on the street,And my heart fell at your feet.An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.Somebody else stood by your side,And he looked so satisfied.An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.A picture from the past came slowly stealing,As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you.An', suddenly, I got that old time feelingAn' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you,And hold you just the way I used to do.Heaven only knows how much I miss youI can't help it if I'm still in love with you.An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.
Have you ever been down to Haiti, whenThe summer sun was sinkin' lowThere's nothin' but romance, just everywhere you glanceAnd the native hearts are all a-glowBut when the Cuban Queen comes upon the sceneThey all stare like a statue out of stoneAnd when they realize what's before their eyesThe other girls are left all alone.Down in the Caribbean, it's not a dream you're seein'When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charmBut from miles away you can see her swayTo the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms.Up in a tree so high, way up in the skySits a wide-eyed monkey on a limbHe wonders why the people go to so much troubleJust to try to be like himHe doesn't understand, that it's a lady's handThat makes a heart feel so sublimeBut before too long, he starts singing the songAnd then he gets in the Conga line.Columbus searched for spices, but he missed the nicestPart of the CaribbeanHe didn't see the charms and the open armsIt was the gold that he was seein'Oh, but I'm glad he missed, the sweetest thing I've kissed'Cause we're on our honeymoonI'm so sorry Chris, to talk about you like thisBut you were five-hundred years too soon.
There's a bird in the sky Flying high, flying highTo a place from a place Changing skies, changing skiesThere are clouds in the sky Clouds of fear and despairBut love like ours never dies Changing skies, changing skiesLittle bird have you heard Freedom lies, freedom liesBut love like ours never dies Just changing skies, changing skies

Riding on the city of New OrleansIllinois central Monday morning railFifteen cars and fifteen restless ridersThree conductors and twenty-five sacks of mailAll along the southbound odysseyThe train pulls out at KankakeeRolls along past houses, farms and fieldsPassin' trains that have no namesFreight yards full of old black menAnd the graveyards of the rusted automobiles[Chorus]Good morning, America How are you?Don't you know me? I'm your native sonI'm the train they call the city of New OrleansAnd I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is doneDealin' card games with the old men in the club carPenny a point ain't no one keepin' scorePass the paper bag that holds the bottleFeel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floorAnd the sons of Pullman PortersAnd the sons of engineersRide their father's magic carpets made of steelMothers with their babes asleepAre rockin' to the gentle beatAnd the rhythm of the rails is all they feel[Chorus]Nighttime on the city of New OrleansChanging cars in Memphis, TennesseeHalf way home, we'll be there by morningThrough the Mississippi darknessRolling down to the seaAnd all the towns and people seemTo fade into a bad dreamAnd the steel rails still ain't heard the newsThe conductor sings his song againThe passengers will please refrainThis trains got the disappearing railroad blues[Chorus]
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dreamYet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil schemeA memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apartWhy can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heartAnother love before my time made your heart sad and blueAnd so my heart is paying now for things I didn't doIn anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops startWhy can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heartYou'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cryYou know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to tryWhy do you run and hide from life to try it just ain't smartWhy can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heartThere was a time when I believed that you belonged to meBut now I know your heart is shackled to a memoryThe more I learn to care for you the more we drift apartWhy can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
A cold November wind can cut right through your soulEven leaves all hide away from the wind November blowsAnd after all the warmth of the summer and the fallCold November wind cuts the deepest of them allA cold November wind will catch you by surpriseYou think you're safely wrapped in love till the wind begins to riseAnd after all the warmth of a love that had it allA cold November wind is the hardest way to fallWe wonder why love seasons change when did the chill beginPerhaps our love was swept away by a cold November windAnd after all the warmth of the summer and the fallCold November wind cuts the deepest of them allWe wonder why love seasons change when did the chill beginPerhaps our love was swept away by a cold November windPerhaps our love was swept away by a cold November wind

Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond of Each Other)Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas.There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend.And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes.No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine.And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear.Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women.But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother.And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper.And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead.So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister.You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother.And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out.And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.

I've had fame and fortune Women come knock on my doorI've lived to the limit maybe a little bit moreThere are so many stories of how I got out of controlSome say it's a womanSome say it's my troubled soul I'm like a crazy old soldierFighting a war on my ownJust me and the whiskey And the bottles are ten thousand strongYou'd think I'd give up As many times as I've been hitBut like a crazy old soldier I just don't know when to quit Barrooms and bedroomsAre just faces and places and namesOnce for the pleasure And Lord knows once for the painI've tried to forget herAnd all of the things that we've doneBut as long as there are memoriesI'll never hang up my gun I'm like a crazy old soliderFighting the war on my ownJust me and the whiskey And the bottles are ten thousand strongYou'd think I'd give upAs many times as I've been hitBut like crazy old soldierI just don't know when to quitLike a crazy old soldier I just don't know when to quit
If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbyeIt's no secret you feel better if you cryWhen waking from a bad dream don't you sometimes think it's realBut it's only false emotions that you feelIf your heartaches seem to hang around too longAnd your blues keep gettin' bluer with each songRemember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy skySo let your head down and go on and cryIf your heartaches...[ guitar ]

The morning that you left me was just another dayHow could I see the sorrow that had found meThen you left and told me that I was in your wayAnd I turned and ran as heaven fell around meI stumbled through the darkness my footsteps were unsureI live within a world that had no sunshineWhen you left me darling my world came to an endAnd there was darkness on the face of the earthThe stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be foundThe sun was in a million pieces scattered all aroundWhy did you ever leave me you knew how it would hurtAnd now there's darkness on the face of the earthThe stars fell out of heaven...And now there's darkness on the face of the earth

This looks like a December day.This looks like a "time to remember" day.And I remember the spring, such a sweet tender thing.And love's summer college,Where the green leaves of knowledge,Were waiting to fall with the fall. And where September wine,Numbed the measure of time.Through the tears of October, now November's over,And this looks like a December day. This looks like a December day.It looks like we've come to the end of the way.And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning,Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending:The ending that won't go away. And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning,Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending:The ending that won't go away. And this looks like a December day.

I threw my robe on in the morningWatched the ring on the stove turn redStared hypnotized into a cup of coffeePulled on my boots and made the bedScreen door hangin' off its hingesKept bangin' me awake all nightAs I look out the windowThe only thing in sightIs dry lightning on the horizon lineJust dry lightning and you on my mind.I chased the heat of her bloodLike it was the holy grailDescend beautiful spiritInto the evening paleHer appaloosa'sKickin' in the corral smelling rainThere's a low thunder rolling'Cross the mesquite plainBut there's just dry lightning on the horizon lineIt's just dry lightning and you on my mindI'd drive down to Alvarado StreetWhere she'd dance to make ends meetI'd spend the night over my ginAs she'd talk to her menWell the piss yellow sunComes bringin' up the dayShe said "Ain't nobody can give nobodyWhat they really need anyway."Well you get so sick of the fightin'You lose your fear of the endBut I can't lose your memoryAnd the sweet smell of your skinAnd it's just dry lightning on the horizon lineJust dry lightning and you on my mind
Dusty skies I can't see nothing in sightGood old Dan you'll have to guide me rightFor we lose our way the cattle will strayAnd we lose them all tonightWith all of the grass and water's goneWe'll have to keep the cattle moving onSand blowing I just can't breathe in this airThought it would soon be clear and fairBut the dust storms were bad they took all we hadI've got to be moving somewhere I hate to leave the old ranch so bareBut I've got to be moving somewhereSo get along doggies we're moving off of this rangeNever thought as how I'd make the changeBut the blue skies have failed we're on our last trailUnderneath these dusty skiesThese ain't tears in my eyes just sand from these dusty skies

When I look out over a green field of cloverOr watch the sunset at the end of the dayI get kind of moody when I see such beautyAn' everything's beautiful in it's own wayI see a fountain flow from a mountainOr see April showers bring flowers to MayI can't help but ponder, life is such a wonderAn' everything's beautiful in it's own wayWords can't describe what I feel insideWhen I see the beauty in each coming dayWhat my eyes behold can't be bought or soldAn' everything's beautiful in it's own wayWhen I see the clouds form a black summer windstormThat uproots the harvest and hurls it awayIn the midst of such anger, destruction and dangerThe storm's even beautiful in it's own wayWhen I see the leaves drop from off of the treetopsOr see the snow fall on a cold winter's dayMy thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonderGod, made all things beautiful in their own wayWords can't describe what I feel insideWhen I see the beauty in each coming dayWhat my eyes behold can't be bought or soldAn' everything's beautiful in it's own wayIn it's own wayIn it's own way

These lines in my face, caused from worry,Grow deeper as you walk out of sight.Mine is the face of a fighter,But my heart has just lost the fight. Round one: you told me you loved me,An' I felt my heart falling there an' then.The last round: you walked tall an' left me,An' I guess my heart's losing again. Mine is the face of a fighter:I fought for your love with all my might.Mine is the face of fighter,But my heart has just lost the fight. Yes, mine is the face of a fighter:I fought for your love with all my might.Mine is the face of fighter,But my heart has just lost the fight.
When I look at the letter that you wrote to meIt's you that I'm thinking ofAs I read the lines that to me were so sweetI remember our faded love[Chorus]I miss you darlin' more and more every dayAs heaven would miss the stars aboveWith every heartbeat I still think of youAnd remember our faded loveAs I think of the past and all the pleasure we had,As I watch the mating of a dove,And it was in the springtime that we said goodbye.I remember our faded love.[Chorus]
There's a family Bible on the table Each page is torn and hard to readBut the family Bible on the table Will ever be my key to memoriesAt the end of day when work was over And when the evening meal was doneDad would read to us from the family BibleAnd we'd count our many blessings one by oneI can see us sittin' round the table When from the family Bible dad would readI can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages Rock of ages cleft for meNow this old world of ours is full of trouble This old world would also better beIf we'd find more Bibles on the tables And mothers singing rock of ages cleft for meI can see us sittin' round the table When from the family Bible dad would readI can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

Let's have a hand for that young cowboy and wish him better luck next timeI hope we'll see him up in Fargo or somewhere farther down the lineThis time he sure drew a bad one one that nobody could rideBy the way he pulled his hat on you know he'd be there for the fightAnd it's the classic contradiction the unavoidable afflictionAnd it don't take much to predict son the way it always goes'Cause one day she'll say she loves you and the next she'll be tired of youAnd push'll always come to shove you on that midnight rodeoHe almost made it to the buzzer somehow he gave up in the endHe put one hand around the other and let that pick up man on inIt was his last chance to ride it now he'll have to move alongBut he knows back in his mind that he won't be away for longAnd it's the classic contradiction...So let's have a hand for that young cowboy and wish him better luck next timeI hope we'll see him up in Fargo or somewhere farther down the line

Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest timeI just keep thinking and your memory is forever on my mindYou know I'll always love you and I can't forget the days when you were mineForgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest timeThe bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousyOh what a heartache but I forgive the things you said to meCause I believe forgiving is the only way that I'll find peace of mindAnd forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest timeThe years have passed so quickly as once again fate steals a young man's dreamsOf all the golden years and growing old together you and meYou asked me to forgive you you said there was another on your mindForgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest timeForgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
It's four in the morning and once more the dawningWoke up the wanting in meWishing I'd never met her knowing if I'd forget herHow much better off she would beThe longer that I hold on and the longer that it goes on the harder that it's gonna beIt's four in the morning and once more the dawningJust woke up the wanting in meI've never deserved her God knows when I hurt herThat's the last thing I wanna doShe knows but she can't tell how she feels but I knowToo well what she's going throughAnd if I love her so much I don't know why I can't doThe right thing and just let her beIt's four in the morning and once more the dawningJust woke up the wanting in meLast night I told her this time it's all overMaking ten times I told her goodbyeLast night we broke up this morning I woke upAnd for the tenth time I'm changing my mindI saw more love in her eyes when I left her than most foolish men will ever seeIt's four in the morning and once more the dawningJust woke up the wanting in meFour in the morning once more the dawning just woke up the wanting in me

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soulWith a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coalFrosty the snowman is a fairy tale they sayHe was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one dayThere must have been some magic in that old silk that they foundFor when they placed it on his head he began to dance aroundOh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could beAnd the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and meFrosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that daySo he said let's run and have some fun now before I melt awayDown to the village with a broomstick in his handRunning here and there all around the square saying catch me if you canHe led them down the streets of town right to the traffic copAnd he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stopFrosty the snowman had to hurry on his wayBut he waved goodbye saying don't you cry I'll be back again some day

Why do I still write why do I still callWhy do I still think there's hope for us at allThese are the tings I hate but they're the things I do to get over youSunsets make me cry old pictures make me grinBut I don't really care to see your face againThese are the things I say but they're so hard to do like gettin' over youYou gotta believe that there's a reason that we surrender up our heartsBut there's a vantage point and it takes some time to findWhere you can see how all the pieces fit as you watch 'em fall apartNow I don't think it's right and you don't know what's wrongMy heart keeps asking me just where do we belongIt's not as though my life ain't hard enough to do try gettin' over youYou gotta believe that there's a reason...Now other people say stop living in the pastBut when there's nothin' left it's your memory that lastsIt's later than you think but still this isn't through this gettin' over youNow it's later than you think and still this isn't through this gettin' over you
Go away; can't you see I'm cryin'?Go back to the new love that you've found.Don't sweet talk me, 'cause I ain't listenin',And you'll only make things worse by hangin' round. I know that I'd be crazy,If I took you back again.But this foolish heart of mine,Might just weaken and give in.So go away,I feel much better when you're gone.For you're the one who made me cry.Now let me cry alone. I know that I'd be crazy,If I took you back again.But this foolish heart of mine,Might just weaken and give in.So go away,I feel much better when you're gone.For you're the one who made me cry.Now let me cry alone.

Make you break downShatter your illusions of loveIs it over now? Do you know howTo pick up the pieces and go home? Rock on, ancient queenFollow those who pale in your shadowRulers make bad loversYou better put your kingdom up for sale Well, did he make you cry, make you break down?Shatter your illusions of loveIs it over now? Do you know howTo pick up the pieces and go home? Did he make you cry, make you break down?Shatter your illusions of loveIs it over now? Do you know howTo pick up the pieces and go home?

All the years combine, they melt into a dream,A broken angel sings from a guitar.In the end there's just a song comes cryin' up the nightThrough all the broken dreams and vanished years.Stella blue. Stella blue.When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see,There's just the pavement left and broken dreams.In the end there's still that song comes cryin' like the wind.Down every lonely street that's ever beenStella blue. Stella blue.I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying.Dust off those rusty strings just one more time,Gonna make them shine, shineIt all rolls into one and nothing comes for free,There's nothing you can hold, for very long.And when you hear that song come crying like the wind,It seems like all this life was just a dream.Stella blue. Stella blue
At a time when the world seems to be spinnin' hopelessly out of control,There's deceivers an' believers an' old in-betweeners,That seem to have no place to go.Well, it's the same old song, it's right an' it's wrong,An' livin' is just somethin' that I do.An' with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes,An' I found myself in you. I looked to the stars, tried all of the bars.An' I've nearly gone up in smoke.Now my hand's on the wheel, I've something that's real,An' I feel like I'm goin' home.An' in the shade of an oak down by the river,Sit an old man an' a boy,Settin' sail, spinnin' tales an' fishin' for whales,With a lady they both enjoy.Well, it's the same damn tune, it's the man in the moon.It's the way that I feel about you.An' with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes,An' I found myself in you.An' I looked to the stars, tried all of the bars.An' I've nearly gone up in smoke.Now my hand's on the wheel, I've something that's real,An' I feel like I'm goin' home.Instrumental break.
I'm sorry but you come to the wrong house But I know who those flowers are forThe flowers that you have are for Someone who's happy And happiness lives next doorSomeone sends her flowers each evening And her young heart is flooded with joySo don't keep her waiting Deliver her flowers to happiness Who lives next doorThe only one who would send flowers to you Is gone to return no moreBut there's some consolation to know Someone is happy And happiness lives next doorThe only one who would send flowers to you Is gone to return no more
I saw the harbor lightsThey only told me we were partingThe same old harbor lights that once brought you to meI watch'd the harbor lightsHow could I help if tears were starting?Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery seaI longed to hold you near and kiss you just once moreBut you were on the ship and I was on the shoreNow I know lonely nightsFor all the while my heart is whisperingSome other harbor lightsWill steal your love from me

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did rideWith sword and pistol by my sideMany a young maid lost her baubles to my tradeMany a soldier shed his lifeblood on my bladeThe bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-fiveBut I am still alive.I was a sailor. I was born upon the tideAnd with the sea I did abide.I sailed a schooner round the Horn to MexicoI went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blowAnd when the yards broke off they said that I got killedBut I am living still.I was a dam builder across the river deep and wideWhere steel and water did collideA place called Boulder on the wild ColoradoI slipped and fell into the wet concrete belowThey buried me in that great tomb that knows no soundBut I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and around and aroundI fly a starship across the Universe divideAnd when I reach the other sideI'll find a place to rest my spirit if I canPerhaps I may become a highwayman againOr I may simply be a single drop of rainBut I will remainAnd I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..
I thought if I could be with you Maybe I'd feel betterBut I'm afraid I took advantage of your loveI thought if you'd just hold me tight Maybe I'd forget herBut I don't suppose as yet You've held me tight enoughPlease hold me tighter I still rememberPut your arms around me Hold me close, hold me tight and longPlease hold me tighter I still remember And I can't love again Until her memory's gonePlease hold me tighter

Home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you,Or any place on earth that you may be.Home is where you're happy, just any house will do,And I'll feel at home as long as you're with me.This room could not hold me for one short minute;If you weren't here with me, I'd soon be gone.That chair is just a chair when you're not in it.It takes more than rooms and chairs to make a home.Home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you,Or any place on earth that you may be.Home is where you're happy, just any house will do,And I'll feel at home as long as you're with me.Time, someday, may cause this house to crumble,But we'll move into another, love and all.And if time, someday, should make your footsteps stumble,I'll be there to catch you, should you fall.Home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you,Or any place on earth that you may be.Home is where you're happy, just any house will do,And I'll feel at home as long as you're with me.
What used to be my home has changed to just a place to stayA crumbling last resort when day is throughSometimes between sundown and dawn somehow I find my wayTo this home motel on Lost Love AvenueNo one seems to really care if I come here at allAnd the one who seems to care the least is youI'm gonna hang a neon sign with letters big and blueHome Motel on Lost Love Avenue
I'm sittin' in the railway station got a ticket for a destinationOn a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in handAnd every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man bandHomeward bound I wish I was homeward boundHome where my thought's escaping home where my music's playingHome where my love lies waiting silently for meEvery day's an endless stream of cigarettes and magazinesAnd each town looks the same to me for movies and the factoriesAnd every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to beHomeward bound...[ guitar ]But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrityLike emptiness and harmony I need someone to comfort meHomeward bound...[ guitar ]
Low down leaving sun, I've doneDid everything that needs doneWoe is me, why can't I seeI'D best be leaving well enough aloneThem neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fightsThem keep a-haunting me in memoriesThere's one in every crowd, for crying out loudWhy was it always turning out to be me[Chorus: x2]Where does it go,the good Lord only knowsIt seems like it was just the other dayI was down at Green Gables, hawking them tablesAnd generally blowing all my hard earned payPiano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoesThere weren't another other way to beFor loveable losers, no account boozersAnd honky tonk heroes like me

High on a mountain in western MontanaA silhouette moves cross a cinnamon skyRidin' along on a horse he called MusicWith a song on his lips, and a tear in his eyeHe dreams of a time and a lady that loved himAnd how he would sing her sweet lullabyeBut we don't ever ask him, and he never talks about herI guess its better to just let it slideAnd he sings oooh to the ladiesAnd oooh he makes 'em sighNow he rides away on a horse he called MusicWith a pain in his heart and a tear in his eyeNow he rode the Music from Boston to BozemanFor not too much money, and way too much rideBut those were the days when a horse he called MusicCould jump through the moon and sail across the skyNow all that's left is a old time worn cowboyWith nothing more than the sweet bye and byeTrailin' behind is a horse with no riderA horse he calls Memories that she used to rideBut he sang oooh to the ladiesAnd oooh he damn near laid down and diedNow he rides away on a horse he called MusicWith a pain in his heart and a tear in his eyesHigh on a mountain in western MontanaTwo crosses cut through a cinnamon skyMarking a place where a horse he called MusicLays with a cowboy in the sweet bye and bye

I've been walking in the shadows for so long that I forgot the sun can shineI've turned away from everyone and everything that wanted to be mineSomehow I always shot my eyes and heart to everything that I could shareNow I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been thereAnd every path I've taken I have turned around and quickly closed the doorIt seems as though I knew if I ever stop to feel I want moreI kept a steady run so my eyes could never focus anywhereNow I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been thereHow long have you been standing there protecting me from love that shouldn't beKnowing all alone that I could realize that you were meant for meNow I've got to mend every broken fence and bridge that I have burnedI've got to clear away the cobwebs in my heart so I can start to learnFor I realize that you've been waiting just to teach me how to careNow I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been thereAnd now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there

You treated me like a doggone dog for so longBut I went along to keep peace in our homeBut there's some things that I just won't doI think it's time that I told them to youI don't do windows and I won't go to hell for youAlthough honey, hell is what you put me throughI'll do the clothes if you won't come ungluedAnd I'll clean the stove to keep you in a good moodBut you've been mean to me sometimeI think I better tell you what's on my mindI don't do windows and I don't come to work 'til nineAnd if you make me mad, I won't come to work any time?Honey, I'm tired of being just one of your toyAnd there's one more thing that you don't understandI wanna be treated like a natural manI don't do windows and I don't play second handsI said I don't do windows and I won't ? in your pants
I don't feel anything what was I worried forI don't feel love or hate or anything that I felt beforeWhy was I so afraid of seeing you againCause it's the strangest thing I don't feel anythingHow I must have loved you once upon a timeAnd I can't seem to feel emotion now of any kindWhy was I so afraid of seeing you again'Cause it's the strangest thing I don't feel anythingYou look the same as always time's been good to youBut I must confess that time has done a few things for me tooWhy was I so afraidBut it's the strangest thing I don't feel anything
It don't hurt anymore All my teardrops are dried No more walkin' the floor With that burnin' inside Just to think it could be Time has opened the door And at last I am free I don't hurt anymore (Chorus) No use to deny I wanted to die The day you said we were thru But now that I find you're out of my mind I can't believe that it's true I've forgotten somehow That I cared so before And it's wonderful now I don't hurt anymore (Repeat Chorus)
There are those who can leave love or take itLove to them is just what they make itI wish that I were the sameBut love is my fav'rite game I fall in love too easilyI fall in love too fastI fall in love too terribly hardFor love to ever lastMy heart should be well-schooled'Cause I've been burned in the pastAnd still I fall in love too easilyI fall in love too fast
I fall to piecesEach time I see you againI fall to piecesHow can I be just your friendYou want me to actLike we've never kissedYou want me to forgetPretend we've never metAnd I try and I tryBut I haven't yetYou walk by and I fall to piecessoloI fall to piecesEach time someone speaks your nameI fall to piecesTime only acts to the playYou tell me to find someone else to loveSomeone who loves me tooThe way you used to doBut each time I go out with someone newYou walk by and I fall to pieces
There goes the man who gave his heart to someone,I feel sorry for him.For that someone just gave her to me.Now, he's the loser an' it hurts so much to lose.An' I feel sorry for him,'Cause the loser, I know, could have been me.Oh, how he loved her:I'm sure he must have loved her almost as much as me.But fate has frowned on him,Then turned around and smiled on me.There goes a man who gave his heart to someone,I feel sorry for him.'Cause that someone just gave her to me.If things were different:If he had won her heart instead of me,I wonder if he'd find the time,To offer sympathy.There goes a man who gave his heart to someone,I feel sorry for him.For that someone just gave her to me.

I guess I've come to live here in your eyes.This must be the place called paradise.You are so precious to me,What a special time within our lives.And I guess I've come to live here in your eyes. A thousand times I see youAnd a thousand times you take my breath away.Fears and doubts consume me and I'm afraid someone will take it all away.I hope we're here forever, but I guess it's time that we both realized.That I guess I've come to live here in your eyes. I guess I've come to live here in your eyes.This must be the place called paradise.You are so precious to me,What a special time within our lives.And I guess I've come to live here in your eyes. A thousand times I see youAnd a thousand times you take my breath away.Fears and doubts consume me and I'm afraid someone will take it all away.I hope we're here forever, but I guess it's time that we both realized.That I guess I've come to live here in your eyes.

You say your heart will never break:I hope so, for your sake.But happiness is sometimes hard,For hearts to cling to.You say he'll always be with you:I hope so, for your sake.But should he find somebody new,What would you do? If you were wrong, would you confess?I wouldn't know, but I could guess,That you would act the same as I,An' cry.And should these things ever come true,When love is gone, what will you do?Will you accept my love for you?I hope so, for my sake. If you were wrong, would you confess?I wouldn't know, but I could guess,That you would act the same as I,An' cry.And should these things ever come true,When love is gone, what will you do?Will you accept my love for you?I hope so, for my sake.
I had not planned on seeing youI was afraid of what I'd doBut pride is strong, here am IAnd I just can't let you say goodbyePlease have no fear, you're in no harmAs long as you're here in my armsBut you can't leave so please don't tryBut I just can't let you say goodbyeWhat force behind your evil mindCan let your lips speak so unkindTo one who loves as much as II just can't let you say goodbyeThe flesh around your throat is paleIntended by my fingernailsPlease don't scream and please don't cryCause I just can't let you say goodbyeYour voice is still, it speaks no moreYou'll never hurt me anymoreDeath is a friend to love and ICause now you'll never say goodbye
I'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't goAnd the first to say be happy if you canBut you lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you soDo you mind too much if I don't understandI suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to doLife is short and sweet break all the hearts you canI guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to youBut do you mind too much if I don't understandForgive me but it all seems so unreal to meAnd my heart and me we'd made so many plansBut that's all over now there's nothing left to doBut do you mind too much if I don't understand(Do you mind too much) if I don't understand
I just dropped by to see the house I used to live inI hope that you don't mind I won't stay very longSo long ago someone and I lived here together And then so suddenly I found myself aloneI couldn't stand the thought Of living here without herAnd so I moved away to let my memories dieBut my memories outlived my own judgementThis may sounds strange to you But I just thought I'd drop byThe very door you're standing in She used to stand thereAnd wait for me to come home every nightAnd when I'd see her standing there I'd run to meet herThese things were on my mind so I just thought I'd drop byI guess that I should leave Someone just might not understandAnd I'm aware of how the neighbors like to cryBut you can tell them all today a happy manWas in the neighborhood And he just thought he'd drop by
I always go the other way but my car drove me down todayTo a little house on the older side of townBack when things were never hard I used to play there in that yardAnd I just drove by to see if things had changedCokes were just a nickel then and across the street at the five and tenA lot of things were cheap and square and strangeAnd the life that we had might have been but it was one we loved believin' inAnd I just drove by to see if things had changedI wondered now if love is still the way it was back thenI need to know that life is still a place worth livin' inThere it is just like it was a place where there was always loveAnd I just drove by to see if things had changedIn a world that seen it's better days it's good to know some things remain the sameThough standing still is not times wayTake to heart while in it's spring oh love is just a fragile thingAnd I just drove by to see if things had changedI wondered now if love is still...I just drove by to see if things had changed
I see you watchin' me just like a hawkI don't mind the way you talkBut if you touch me somethings got to giveI live the life I love and I love the life I liveMy diamond ring and my money tooTomorrow night they could belong to youThe girl move me at their willI live the life I love and I love the life I live[Chorus:]I may lay a hundred on a bet this timeTomorrow night can't cover your dimeNext week I could be over the hillI'm just tryin' to tell you people how I feelYou see me rockin' as I pass you byDon't talk about me cause I could be highJust forgive me if you willI live the life I love and I love the life I live[Chorus]You see me rockin' as I pass you byDon't talk about me cause I could be highJust forgive me if you willI live the life I love and I love the life I live

I'd have to be crazyTo stop all my singingAnd never play music again.You'd call me a foolIf I put on a top hatAnd ran out to flag down the wind.I'd have to be weirdTo grow me a beardJust to see what the rednecks would do.I'd have to be crazyPlum out of my mindTo fall out of love with you.You know I(and I don't intend to)But should there come a day,When I say that I don't love youThey'll lock me away ay ay.It sure would be weirdTo live in an envelope Waiting along for a stampYou'd swear I was locoTo rub for a genieWhile burning my hand on the lampAnd I may not be normalBut nobody isSo I'd like to say 'fore I'm throughI'd have to be crazyPlum out of my mindTo fall out of love with you
You told me you'd love me forever But the one in your arms is not meSo if this is what you refer to as loveThen I'd rather you didn't love meI have waited so long for your love now But I've made up my mind it can't beFor if I am just one of the many you love Then I'd rather you didn't love meHow can I name the one to blame I suppose it's the way you believeBut if this is what you refer to as love Then I'd rather you didn't love meAnd if I am just one of the many you love Then I'd rather you didn't love meI'd rather you didn't love me
I'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterdayBut what good is life without the one you loveI'd trade all of my tomorrows they're worthless anywayIf I can't hold the one I'm dreaming ofJust an empty world is all I have before me I'd give anything if you were with me nowI'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterdayI don't want to live without you anyhow[ guitar ]Just an empty world...

Come on now, Willie,Don't look at me that way.I know you like a paperback book,'cause I've read every page.I know what you're thinkin',And I don't think you're thinkin' at all.This is old Hoss that you're talkin' to:The one with the perfect recall.No I ain't goin' down on the border with you tonight.Drinkin' tequila, taking chances on our lives.All the women are crazy, they like to party 'til daylight.On second thought, if I can find a clean shirt, I might.Wait a minute, Waylon,I ain't said a thing about that.Sometimes I just like to wear my spurs,And my old Mexican hat.But we sure had fun the last time,That we were down there.And when we woke up, you had that weird tattoo,And somebody had curled my hair.No I ain't goin' down on the border with you tonight.Drinkin' tequila, taking chances on our lives.All the women are crazy, they like to party 'til daylight.On second thought, if I can find a clean shirt, I might.All the women are crazy, and they like to party 'til daylight.On second thought, if I can find a clean shirt, I might.
If I had my way, dear, forever there'd beA garden of roses for you and for meA thousand and one things, dear, I would doJust for you, just for youIf I had my way, we would never grow oldAnd sunshine I'd bring every dayYou would reign all alone like the queen on a throneIf I had my wayIf I had my way we would never, oh girl, grow oldAnd sunshine I'd bring every dayYou would reign all alone like a queen on a throneIf I had my way
She always follows me from town to townAt least her memories follow me aroundWhenever I clear my mind so she can seeI feel her love come rushing into meAnd I know that I will never be aloneIt looks as though her memory's bound to hauntAnd I know my love will always stay in boundsWith her memory always following me aroundFollowing me around, following me aroundFollowing me around, following me aroundAnd I know my love will always stay in boundsWith her memory always following me aroundFollowing me around, following me aroundFollowing me around, following me aroundAnd I know my love will always stay in boundsWith her memory always following me aroundWith her memory always following me around
If I were a paintingCaptured on canvasAlone in the portrait I would standAnd brush strokes boldYet soft as a whisperThe work of a feminine handCaught in a still lifeSurrounded by shadowsAnd lost in a background of blueIf I were a paintingMy price would be painAnd the artist would have to be youI imagine the colorsWould all run togetherIf you ever allowed me to crySo don't paint the tearsJust let me remember meWithout you in my eyesIt's only the frameThat holds me togetherOr else I would be falling apartIf I were a paintingI wouldn't feelAnd you wouldn't be breaking my heart
They all sat around in a circle laughing and all telling liesThen the tall one he bumped in a dollar se said boys I've got nothing to hideThe King and the Queen stood together then the ace he would not be to blameAnd if the cards were all laid on the table then love could be more than a gameAnd if the stars didn't shine on the water then the sun wouldn't burn on the sandAnd if I were the man you wanted I would not be the man that I amAnd I have seen my share of long nights and I have told my share of lies And I have run into the darkness when I saw the look in your eyes But if the night didn't lie in the darkness then the daylight would be hard to find And if the truth didn't turn to a weakness I would have never have spoken my mind And if the stars didn't shine on the water...So if you're going out to Carolina then don't linger in New MexicoAnd if you think of the one there behind you then you might not feel so aloneAnd if the stars didn't shine on the water...And if I were the man you wanted I would not be the man that I am
If it's wrong to love you Wrong I'll always beAnd though the world may scorn me Darling, can't you seeIf it's wrong to want you When my day is throughGladly I will pay for All my dreams of youAnd though we met too late, dear And you'll never knowThat without a right to I have loved you soI can't change my heart now You're a part of meSo if it's wrong to love you Wrong I'll always beAnd though we met too late, dear And you'll never knowThat without a right to I have loved you soI can't change my heart now You're a part of meSo if it's wrong to love you Wrong I'll always be

Funny a woman can come on so wild and freeYet insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch meAnd stand by my bed and shiver as if she were coldJust to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were goldOne night of love can't make up for six nights aloneBut I'd rather have one than none Lord cause I'm flesh and boneAnd sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at allBut she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at allRight or wrong a woman can own any manShe can take him inside her and hold his soul in her handThen leave him as weak and weary as a newborn childFighting to get his first breath and open his eyesOne night of love can't make up...And sometimes it seems...

If you really loved me You wouldn't treat me this wayAnd you'd be kind enough To leave some life while I'm awayAnd I might cry when you go But I won't die when you goAnd someday someone just might come alongIf you really loved me You wouldn't test me this wayYou wouldn't leave the choice of leaving up to meBut I'm too proud to survive Cause I'm more dead than aliveCause someday someone just might come along

I'm a game that you used to play I'm a plan that you didn't lay so wellI'm a fire that burns in your mind Close your eyes I'm a memoryI'm a love that you know from a song I'm a voice on a green telephoneAnd I'm a day that lasted so long Close your eyes I'm a memoryI'm a dream that comes with the night And I'm a face that fades with the lightAnd I'm a tear that falls out of sight Close your eyes I'm a memory

It's so damn easy to say that life's so hardEverybody's got their share of battle scarsAs for me, I'd like to thank my lucky starsThat I'm alive and wellAnd it'd be easy to add up all the painAnd all the dreams you sat and watched go up in flamesYou were on, on their wreckage as it smolders in the rainBut not me, I'm aliveAnd today you know that's good enough for meBreathing in and outs a blessing, cant you see?Today is the first day of the rest of my lifeAnd I'm alive and well, God, I'm alive and wellStars are dancing on the water here tonightIt's good for the soul when there's not a soul in sightThis boat has caught its wind and brought me back to lifeNow I'm alive and wellAnd today you know that's good enough for meBreathing in and outs a blessing, cant you see?Today is the first day of the rest of my lifeAnd I'm alive and well, God, I'm alive and well
I'm confessin' that I love you Tell me, do you love me too?I'm confessin' that I need you,Honest I do, need you every moment!In your eyes I read such strange things,But your lips deny they're trueWill your answer really change things,Making me blue?I'm afraid someday you'll leave me,Say'n can't we still be friends?If you go, you know you'll grieve me,All in life on you depends Am I guessin' that you love me?Dreamin' dreams of you in vain,I'm confessin' that I love you,Over again!I'm afraid someday you'll leave me,Say'n can't we still be friends?If you go, you know you'll grieve me,All in life on you depends Am I guessin' that you love me?Dreamin' dreams of you in vain,I'm confessin' that I love you,Over again!
I'm falling in love againNever thought I would againNever I thought I wouldAnd I may be making mistakes againBut if I lose or winHow will I know? How will I know?How will I know? How will I know?And I'm falling in love againAnd if I lose or winHow will I know?
I'm going round in circles, acting like a fool,I've played the game of love,And I don't even know the rules.I gave my heart to someone,She broke it, just today.An' I'm gonna lose a lot of teardrops this way. I suppose I should be careful but how was I to know?She looked so sweet and innocent,But that's the way it goes.It happens to the best of us,At least, that's what they say.But I'm gonna lose a lot of teardrops this way. Something sure had better change,But what am I to do?Surely there's someone around,Who needs a love that's true. But I guess I'll keep on searching,But one thing I can say:I'm gonna lose a lot of teardrops this way. Something sure had better change,But what am I to do?Surely there's someone around,Who needs a love that's true. But I guess I'll keep on searching,But one thing I can say:I'm gonna lose a lot of teardrops this way.

Now, many many years agoWhen I was twenty threeI was married to a widowWho was pretty as could be This widow had a grown-up daughterHad hair of redMy father fell in love with herAnd soon the two were wed This made my dad my son-in-lawAnd changed my very lifeMy daughter was my mother'Cause she was my father's wife To complicate the mattersEven though it brought me joyI soon became the fatherOf a bouncing baby boy My little baby then becameA brother-in-law to dadAnd so became my uncleThough it made me very sad For if he was my uncleThat also made him the brotherOf the widow's grown-up daughterWho, of course, was my step-mother I'm my own grandpaI'm my own grandpaIt sounds funny I knowBut it really is soI'm my own grandpa My father's wife then had a sonThat kept them on the runAnd he became my grandchildFor he was my daughter's son My wife is now my mother's motherAnd it makes me blueBecause, she is my wifeShe's my grandmother too I'm my own grandpaI'm my own grandpaIt sounds funny I knowBut it really is soI'm my own grandpa Now, if my wife is my grandmotherThen, I am her grandchildAnd every time I think of itIt nearly drives me wild For now I have becomeThe strangest case you ever sawAs the husband of my grandmotherI am my own grandpa I'm my own grandpaI'm my own grandpaIt sounds funny I knowBut it really is soI'm my own grandpa I'm my own grandpaI'm my own grandpaIt sounds funny I knowBut it really is soI'm my own grandpa

I'm so ashamed of my eyes'Cause they still cry for youAfter they both watched my handWave goodbye to you And I've told them time and time againThat this will never doAnd I've told themHow you always laughed at teardrops I'm so ashamed of my armsFor missing youLast night I woke up just in timeTo see them reach for you And now my heart confessesIt's still wants you tooI'm so ashamed of them allFor loving you I'm so ashamed of my eyes'Cause they still cry for youAfter they both watched my handWave goodbye to you I've told them time and time againThat this will never doAnd I've told themHow you always laughed at teardrops I'm so ashamed of my armsFor missing youLast night I woke up just in timeTo see them reach for you And now my heart confessesIt's still wants you tooI'm so ashamed of them allFor loving you
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill He sounds too blue to flyThat means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cryDid you ever see a night so slow As time goes draggin' byThe moon just went behind the clouds To hide its face and cryThe silence of a falling star Lights up a purple skyAnd as I wonder where you are I'm so lonesome I could cryI'm so lonesome I could cry I'm so lonesome I could cry
No matter what's still not over youToday I made a point to go somewhere I knew you'd beI had to know if you still had the same affect on meAnd the moment that I saw you there I knewNo matter what I do I'm still not over youI can't explain why seeing you affects my sanityBut when I see you I become strange and differentlyAnd the moment that I saw you there I knewNo matter what I do I'm still not over youI'm still not over you that feeling's still the sameI'm still not over you I find that nothing's changedAnd perhaps some day I'll find somebody newBut now it's much too soon I'm still not over youNo matter what I do I'm still not over you

Never think evil thoughts of anyone It's just as wrong to think as to sayFor a thought is but a word that's unspoken In God's eyes He sees it this wayLend a hand if you can to a stranger Never worry if he can't repayFor in time you'll be repaid ten times over In God's eyes He sees it this wayIn God's eyes we're like sheep in a meadow Now and then a lamb goes astrayBut open arms should await it's returning In God's eyes He sees it this wayIn God's eyes we're like sheep in a meadow Now and then a lamb goes astrayBut open arms should await it's returning In God's eyes He sees it this way
I come to the garden aloneWhile the dew is still on the rosesAnd the voice I hear, falling on my earThe Son of God disclosesAnd He walks with meAnd He talks with meAnd He tells me I am His ownAnd the joy we share as we tarry thereNone other has ever knownHe speaks and the sound of His voiceIs so sweet the birds hush their singingAnd the melody that He gave to meWithin my heart is ringingAnd He walks with meAnd He talks with meAnd He tells me I am His ownAnd the joy we share as we tarry thereNone other has ever knownI'd stay in the garden with Him'Tho the night around me be fallingBut He bids me go; through the voice of woeHis voice to me is callingAnd He walks with meAnd He talks with meAnd He tells me I am His ownAnd the joy we share as we tarry thereNone other has ever known

There's something on your mind, why don't you tell me?You act as though your heart is miles away.I speak to you but you don't even hear me.Don't be unkind: is there something on your mind?You look at me with eyes that never see me.You're watching memories down in your heart.Is there someone from the past you can't forget, dear?Don't be unkind: is there something on your mind?Even though you tried your best to love me,I know I can't compete with memories.So tell me now, before the vows are spoken.While there's still time, is there something on your mind?
I am a roving cowboy Ridin' all aloneAnd for such a roving cowboy I've sure made myself at homeI love your sunshine I love your flowers I love your ocean rolling inAnd for such a roving cowboy I've sure found myself a friendI am a cowboy I am a sailor I have drifted far and wideI have crossed the seven oceans I have crossed the Great DivideBut if you're ever looking for me Let me tell you where I'll beI'll be somewhere soaking up sunshine On my island in the sea
Sometimes I thinkThat love is somewhereLivin on an island all aloneI can see it in the darknessI can feel it in the distanceAnd then its goneAnd then I know that it is time For me to go and find my favorite girlCause when I look into her eyes I seeAll the love there is in all the worldAnd it always will beAnd it always will beAnd it always will beIt always will beThere are some things I think aboutAnd every time I do it breaks my heartAnd there is nothing I can doAbout this lonliness I feel when we're apartI stop and curse the darkness and the distanceAnd then your face I seeAnd when I look into your eyes I seeAll the love there is inside of meAnd it always will beAnd it always will beAnd it always will beIt always will beAnd it always will beAnd it always will beAnd it always will beIt always will be
It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of oldFrom angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of goldPeace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious kingThe world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels singStill through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurlAnd still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world.Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wingAnd ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels singOh yeah, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending lowWho toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slowLook now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wingOh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels singFor lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of oldWhen with the ever circling years shall come the time foretoldWhen the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their kingAnd the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing
When we look into each others eyesOur hearts aren't beating wildly as they beat beforeAnd when we hold each other in our armsWe can't receive the same vibrations anymoreAnd when we hear each other speak our namesWe don't hear the ringing and the singing of a million bellsPerhaps our hearing's failing us Perhaps we're hearing other things but who can tellIt could be said that way, it could be said that wayBut I'd much rather say it's time for me to goWhat's the point in making leaving any harder than a leaving really ought to beAnd this road on which I travel paved with broken glass and gravelHas just room for me, I hope there's room for meI suspect that I'll be lonely but I know that if I'm lonely I'll deserve to beAnd I plan to think about you just as often as I will And that's my plans for meIt could be said that way, it could be said that wayBut I'd much rather say it's time for me to goWhat's the use in making rhymes, I'd much rather say it's time for me to go
Now that I've made up my mind you're gone It should be easier nowPerhaps now my heart will stop hangin' on It should be easier nowThe lesson I learned from you gold can't buy A heart can be broken and still surviveThanks to you now a much wiser man am I And it should be easier nowThe worst now is over I've stood the test It should be easier nowThey say everything happens for the best And it should be easier nowThe wounds in my heart you carved deep and wideHollowed and washed by the tears that I've criedNow there'll be more room for love inside It should be easier now
In a way I'm glad it's over even though it's gonna hurt me once you're goneBut I can learn to live without you give me time and I can make it on my ownLoving you to me came easy and losing you will change my life no doubtIn a way I'm glad it's over but another way it turns me inside outIn a way I guess it's better although there's nothing good at goodbyeBut I know I couldn't hold youNow you found your wings and you need room to flyIt's for sure I'm gonna miss you but I guess that's what goodbye is all aboutIn a way I'm glad it's over but another way it turns me inside outOn the one hand I know I'll be better off once you're goneBut I find a lot of heartaches on the otherAnd I can't say that I look forward to those nights I'll be aloneAnd I wonder if there'll ever be anotherLoving you to me came easy and losing you will change my life no doubtIn a way I'm glad it's over but another way it turns me inside outIn a way I'm glad it's over but another way it turns me inside out
The turning earth will raise its wand and bring the seasons to their frutiful end ...and little men and trains will crasl and snake their way around the timeless bend... and rivers, too, will course their way to find the hungry Mother Sea at last .. and love will grow, it will come to pass...The sun will blaze its scorching path across the sky a million times or mroe... and men with charts will scan the skies in quest of life on some forgotten shore... and in the quiet womb the sleeping seed will stretch its arms and grow at last...and love will grow, it will come to pass...(chorus/bridge) It will come to pass....Though men and minds and times will change still pinioned they by fers of growinkg old...though scalpeled hands will plumb the deepest corners none will find the soul... yet bearded men in sandwich boards will tell the sinfuls treets, "He's Come At Last" .. and love will grow, it will come to pass...Words & music by Don Baird (donbaird7@aol.com)Sony/Tree publishing...(From Willie Nelson "My Own Peculiar Way" and other albums... and Anita Kerr Singers "Best of Country"Album ( abc/dot(

It's a sin ,my darling, how I love you Although I know our love can never beIt's a sin to keep this memory of you When silence proves that you've forgotten meThe dreams I built for us have tumbled Each promise broken like my heartWhy pretend that I can't live without you When deep inside I know that it's a sinI hope you're happy with another Who shares the dream I could not winWhy pretend that I can't live without you When deep inside I know that it's a sin

You're my buddy, my pal, my friendIt will be that way until the endAnd wherever you go, I want you to knowYou're my buddy, my pal, my friendAnd I've loved you all over the worldYou are my sunshineYou keep my life in a whirlAnd you love me sometimesI'll always follow my heartWherever it takes meAnd until death do us partI'll love you all over the worldI'll always follow my heartWherever it takes meAnd until death do us partI'll love you all over the world
I close my eyes and watch the darknessWithdraw to my world of make believeThis world is filled with so much sorrowAnd I've seen all this world I care to see I watch as castles fall around meFrom crumbled ruins of my ownThis world is filled with much unhappinessSo many people so alone Seeds that thrive in loveless gardensFruits of such will bitter beFields of hate and greed surround meAnd I've seen all this world I care to see
Well it's four a.m. and you're just gettin' inYour first night out and I won't ask you where you've beenYou're so ashamed and your eyes just can't meet mineYou've seen that look on me a thousand timesWhat makes us do the things we do heaven only knowsWe think we have a secret but it always showsAnd I taught you how to cheat you're doing fineYou've seen that look on me a thousand timesBut I still love you and so I pretend and hope I'll never see that look againBut if we do I know the fault is mine I've seen that look on me a thousand timesI've seen that look on me a thousand times

The lights go out each evening at elevenAnd up and down our block there's not a soundI close my eyes and search for peaceful slumberAnd just then the local memory comes aroundPiles of blues against the door to make sure sleep will come no moreHe's the hardest working memory in this townTurns out happiness again and then lets loneliness back inAnd each night the local memory comes aroundEach day I say tonight I may escape himI pretend I'm happy and never even a frownBut at night I close my eyes and pray sleep finds meBut again the local memory comes aroundRids the house of all good news then sets out my crying shoesWhat a faithful memory never lets me downWe're both up till light of day chasing happiness awayAnd each night the local memory comes aroundAnd each night the local memory comes around
The streets are dark and quiet at London, after midnight.Listen...The silence is the master of darkness, And London can sleep tonight,Protected by the master.London... London...You scream the largest portion of the dayLondon... London...Rest your lungs, tomorrow's on its way.

Each time I see a crowd of peopleJust like a fool I stop and stareIt's really not the proper thing to doBut maybe you'll be thereI go out walking after midnightAlong the lonely thoroughfareIt's not the time or place to look for youBut maybe you'll be thereYou said your arms would always hold meYou said your lips were mine alone to kissNow after all those things you told meHow can it end like this?Some day if all my prayers are answeredI'll hear a footstep on the stairWith anxious heart I'll hurry to the doorAnd maybe you'll be thereYou said your arms would always hold meYou said your lips were mine alone to kissNow after all those things you told meHow can it end like this?Some day if all my prayers are answeredI'll hear a footstep on the stairWith anxious heart I'll hurry to the doorAnd maybe you'll be thereAnd maybe you'll be there
Busted flat in Baton RougeI headed for the trainFeeling nearly faded as my jeansBobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rainedTook us all the way to New OrleansI took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanaAnd was blowing sad while Bobby sang the bluesAnd with the windshield wipers slapping timeAnd Bobby clapping handsWe finally sang every song that driver knew[Chorus]Freedom's just another word for nothing left to loseNothing ain't worth nothing but its freeFeeling good was easy when Bobby sang the bluesAnd buddy that was good enough for meGood enough for me and Bobby McGeeFrom the coal mines of KentuckyTo the California sunBobby shared the secrets of my soulStanding right beside me LordThrough everything I'd doneAnd every night she kept me from the coldThen somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip awayLooking for the home I hope she'll findAnd I'd trade all my tomorrow's for a single yesterdayOf holding Bobby's body next to mine[Chorus]Freedom's just another word for nothing left to loseNothing ain't worth nothing but its freeFeeling good was easy when Bobby sang the bluesAnd buddy that was good enough for meGood enough for me and Bobby McGee

Midnight run down a cold dark road, A load of moonshine on a flatbed ford.The headlights off and the coast is clear, Grab that wheel let go the fear. On a midnight run, Well there might be trouble cause everybodys got a gun, Across that county line, With fifty more cases white lightning apple moonshine. Fight for love, fight for life, Fight for money with the edge of a knife, Rule your fear and rule the night, Rule the road in a lawless fight. Bullets flying through my daddy's door, Now you know my daddy didn't want this war, But if they're looking for trouble they're in the right place, Cause them back wood boys will spit in your face. On a midnight run, Well there might be trouble cause everybodys got a gunAcross that county line, I got fifty more cases of white lightning apple moonshine

What there was left of us Was all covered in dust and thick skinA half eaten apple or the whole Sistine ChapelPainted on the head of a pinA life long love's worth gone up in a smurk And you didn't even see her waltz inNow this love is a ghost having played host To the most unoriginal sinAt the wedding we smiled As some devil played wild violinSoon after the chapel she offered me that appleOne bite and I was gone with the windAnd you needed no proof 'Cause the whole naked truthWas wearin' only an infidel's grinAnd a proud schoolboy's boast of having left his post For the most unoriginal sinNow the jukebox is humming All the venial shortcomings of menLord I found me this drink that can finally sinkAll the skills that I've been wallowing inBuddy once you get started Once true love's departed You do it over and over againSo tonight I will toast just whoever comes closeTo the most unoriginal sinSo tonight I will toast just whoever comes closeTo the most unoriginal sin

I grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy, And Lovin' the cowboy ways.Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes, I burned up my childhood days.I learned of all the rules of the modern-day drifter, Don't you hold on to nothin' too long.Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them, With the words of a sad country song. My heroes have always been cowboys.And they still are, it seems.Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of, Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams. Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery, From being alone too long.You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightman, Knowin' well that your best days are gone.Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen, I let the words of my years fade away.Old worn-out saddles, and 'old worn-out memories, With no one and no place to stay. My heroes have always been cowboys.And they still are, it seems.Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of, Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams. Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of, Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.
My heart takes walks with her on cold and rainy daysShe leads my heart along where only love can lead the wayAnd I know she'll follow me to the end of the worldShe makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girlShe makes to proud to walk the streets of anywhereAnd if our bed be grass or cotton she won't careAnd I know she'll follow me to the end of the worldShe makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girl[ steel ]And I know she'll follow me to the end of the worldShe makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girlAnd I know she'll follow me to the end of the worldShe makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girl

Was it something I did, Lord, a lifetime ago?Am I just now repaying a debt that I owe?Justice sweet justice you travel so slow.But you can't change my love for the rose.
I take a trip every evening scrolling down memory laneI'm walkin' again those familiar paths dreaming those dreams againAnd I can always see my sweetheart just as she used to beWaiting for someone at the garden gate and I know that someone is meBig brown eyes and pearly hair and you'd tell that's MaryRosy cheeks and ruby lips can't you tell that's MaryOfttimes in the evenings we'd go scrollingHand in hand together beneath the pepper treeAnd I can feel her hand in mine as I sit alone tonightDreaming of the times I spent with Mary[ fiddle - guitar ]Ofttimes in the evenings...Oh gee wouldn't it be wonderful to open up the doors of the pastAnd live again as yesterdayBut you know no matter where I wander no matter where I roamThere'll always be a place in my heart boysFofr a girl away back for a girl that I used to call Mary
(I'll always love you in my own peculiar way)It would be a comfort just to know you never doubt meEven though I give you cause most every daySometimes I think that you'd be better off without meAlthough I love you in my own peculiar wayDon't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wonderTo a suddenly remembered yesterday'Cause my mind could never stay too long away from youI'll always love you in my own peculiar wayAnd though I may not always be the way you'd have me beAnd though my faults may grow in number day by dayLet no one ever say that I've ever been untrueI'll always love you in my own peculiar wayI'll always love you in my own peculiar way
Each night I laid there in prisonI pictured a future so brightFor he was the one ray of sunshineThat shone through the darkest of nights My son calls another man daddyHe'll never know my name nor my faceGod only knows how it hurts meFor another to be in my place Each night I laid there in prisonI pictured a future so brightFor he was the one ray of sunshineThat shone through the darkest of nights Today his mother shares a new loveShe just couldn't stand my disgraceMu son calls another man daddyAnd longs for the love he can't replace My son calls another man daddyHe'll never know my name nor my faceGod only knows how it hurts meFor another to be in my place

Well you seem a little colder When I say I must be leavingBut it's an ugly way for us to let it endWhat's the use in being worried Cause I'm going in an hourWhen the time is running out that we can spendWhat's the difference being different When it's difference now that looks alikeYou say I'm changing I'm not sure that's wrongIt's just today it may be natural Sitting here discussing itTomorrow just as natural to be gone[ violin ]There's no season in my mind That I can count on for an answerAnd I dug too many holes expecting snowI'm not sure to where I'm headed now I ride the hard line with itIf I return or when I think I might goWhat's the difference being different...

Read in the paper nearly everyday People breaking up and just walking away from love And that's wrong don't you know that's wrongA happy little home comes up for sale because two fools half tired and failedTo get along and you know that's wrongA man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a manAnd neither one of them try to love and understandAnd take it with a grain of saltA little bit of love is better than no love even sad love's better than no loveEven bad love is better than no love at allA little bit of love is better than no love even bad love's better than no loveAny kind of love is better than no love at allNo love at all is a poor old man standin' on the corner with his hat in his handAnd thare's no place to go, and he's feeling lowNo love at all is a child in the street dodging traffic and a begging to eatOn the tennament row and that's a rough row to hoeNo love at all is a scared young girl, standin' on the bridge on the edge of the worldAnd it's a pretty short fallA little bit of love is better than no loveA little bit of love is better than no love
God painted the bluebonnets in the fields,By a tough little scrub oak, on an east Texas hill.And he plucked the star from a lone star sky,And he put it in the twinkle of a cowboy's eye.The wide open spaces he made wild and free.Texas, as far as any eye can see;And he made her sons grow tough and strong.They still cry when they hear a sad song.[Chorus]No place but TexasWould I ever roam.No place but Texas;My home, sweet home.No place but Texas;My home, sweet home.When I die I hope they bury me By the Pedernales River, 'neath a white oak tree,Where I can see the longhorns grazeAnd the cactus flowers blooming in the morning haze.[Chorus]
There's a circle of people where I'm no longer welcomeI'm ashamed to say that I'm no longer fitI could sober up tomorrow and face my friends againBut I've got no reason to quitNo I've got no reason for living right and there's no other way to forgetI could sober up tomorrow and face my friends againBut I've got no reason to quitI've got no reason for living right and there's no other way to forgetI know down deep inside me I'm man enough to changeBut I've got no reason to quit
The children are sleeping, our talk can begin We've waited until they've gone to bedWe knew they would cry when we said goodbye And I'd rather leave quietly insteadWe can never be happy We both know it's trueWe've quarrelled from the day that we metOur love was too weak to pull our dreams through But too strong to let us forgetI hope we can salvage a few memories To carry us through the long nightsThe clock's striking midnight Yesterday's gone and there's no tomorrow in sightIn our efforts to break through The thick walls of prideWith harsh words that burned to the coreThe walls still remain But the words broke inside And strengthened the walls even moreI hope we can salvage...

I wish I could laugh when I look way backFind out who stole all my dreamsOh I wish it was easy to face the pastThere was nobody there but meAnd it's hard not to smile when I'm back on high groundAnd I'm wishing that someone could seeThen the sun comes up and the dreams die downThere's nobody there but me[ guitar - piano ]It feels so good to be back on dry groundAfter drifting so long at seaAnd when the sun comes up and the dreams die downThere's nobody there but me there's nobody there but me
So you saw her last night with her new loveYes, they tell me they make quite a pairAnd did they both look happy together?I just wonder ... Not that I careTell me, was she as lovely as everLike an angel with golden hairDoes she still close her eyes when she dances?I just wonder ... Not that I careOnce I thought I couldn't live without herFunny how wrong I could beNow, I never even think about herAnd what she does, doesn't mean a thing to meWell, it's late so I guess I'll be goingToo much smoke; what I need is some airAnd by the way, did she ask you about me?I just wonder ... Not that I careI just wonder ... Not that I care
I've got a long list of real good reasonsFor all the things I've doneI've got a picture in the back of my mindOf what I've lost and what I've wonI've survived every situationKnowing when to freeze and when to runAnd regret is just a memory written on my browAnd there's nothing I can do about it now.I've got a wild and a restless spiritI held my price through every dealI've seen the fire of a woman's scornedTurn her heart of gold to steelI've got the song of the voice inside meSet to the rhythm of the wheelAnd I've been dreaming like a childSince the cradle broke the bowAnd there's nothing I can do about it now.Running through the changesGoing through the stagesComing round the corners in my lifeLeaving doubt to fateStaying out too lateWaiting for the moon to say good nightAnd I could cry for the time I've wastedBut that's a waste of time and tears,And I know just what I'd changeIf went back in time somehowBut there's nothing I can do about it nowRunning through the changesGoing through the stagesComing round the corners in my lifeLeaving doubt to fateStaying out too lateWaiting for the moon to say good nightAnd I could cry for the time I've wastedBut that's a waste of time and tearsAnd I know just what I'd changeIf went back in time somehowBut there's nothing I can do about it now.I'm forgiving everything that forgiveness will allowAnd there's nothing I can do about it now

Grab your coat and get your hat leave your worry on the doorstepJust direct your feet to the sunny side of the streetCan't you hear a pitter pat and that happy tune is your stepLife can be so sweet on the sunny side of the streetI used to walk in the shade with those blues on paradeBut I'm not afraid this rover crossed overIf I never have a cent I'll be rich as RockefellerGold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street[ piano - harmonica ]I used to walk in the shade...
I'm so tired of all this trouble now aren't youWe've tried and failed to make our dreams come trueIt seems that we had dream worlds all our ownSo don't you think that we should try it once aloneLife's too short to spend it feeling blueAnd it's not too late our dreams could still come trueBut before our chance for happiness is goneDon't you think that we should try it once aloneIt's not your fault and neither is it mineIt seems that we're just victims of the timesIt's not that I don't love you cause I doBut love alone can't make a dream come trueI suppose that we'll survive the parting tearsWe've survived so many others through the yearsBut before our chance for happiness is goneDon't you think that we should try it once alone
Once in a while will you try to give one little thought to meThough someone else maybe nearer your heartOnce in a while will you dream of the moments I shared with you, Moments before we two drifted apart.In love's smoldering ember, one spark may remain, If love still can remember the spark may burn again.I know that I'll be contented with yesterday's memory, Knowing you think of me once in a while.
Once more with feeling once more with feelingWon't you hold me till the night fades into dayOnce more with feeling once more with feelingHold me close don't let this feeling go awaySometimes myself runs back to you I just can't tell me what to doBut I remember when all wrapped up tight withinThe shelter of my arms you used to stayOnce more with feelingOnce more with feeling
I live one day at a time I dream one dream at a timeYesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind and I live one day at a timeI guess that's your surprise to see me back at homeBut you know how much I miss you when I'm goneBut don't ask how long I planned to stay it never it crossed my mindI live one day at a timeSee that sparrow fly across the cloudy skySearching for a hatch of sunlight so am II wish I didn't have to follow and perhaps I want in timeBut I live one day at a timeI live one day at a time I dream one dream at a timeYesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind and I live one day at a timeAnd I live one day at a time

Over timeThat's what they all tell meThat's what they say to meOver timeYour blue eyes and your black eyelashesThe way you looked at life in your funny wayI guess out of the blue you won't cross my mindAnd I'll get over you over timeYour pale skin and your sexy crooked teethThe trouble you get in in your clumsy wayI guess one afternoon you won't cross my mindAnd I'll get over you over timeI guess out of the blue you won't cross my mindAnd I'll get over you over time
Last evening, I turned by the pages of time.And tore out the chapters when you were mine.I attempted to cut out the memories of you.And paste in some new ones, far better an' true.True. I searched through the chapters, referring to hearts,for the one with the caption: "Till death do us part."I ripped at each letter an' I tore at each word.I screamed at your memory an' nobody heard.Nobody heard. But your memory's determined, and chances are few,Of my ever finding a replacement for you.It desperately clings to the floor of my mind,And fights for its place in the pages of time.
Living on the road my friend,Was gonna keep you free and clean.Now you wear your skin like iron,Your breath as hard as kerosene.You weren't your mama's only boy,But her favorite one it seems.She began to cry when you said goodbye,And sank into your dreams.Pancho was a bandit boy,His horse was fast as polished steel.He wore his gun outside his pantsFor all the honest world to feel.Pancho met his match you knowOn the deserts down in Mexico,Nobody heard his dying words,Ah but that's the way it goes.All the Federales sayThey could have had him any dayThey only let him slip awayOut of kindness, I suppose.Lefty, he can't sing the bluesAll night long like he used to.The dust that Pancho bit down southEnded up in Lefty's mouth.The day they laid poor Pancho low,Lefty split for Ohio.Where he got the bread to go,There ain't nobody knows.All the Federales sayWe could have had him any day.We only let him slip awayOut of kindness, I suppose.The poets tell how Pancho fell,And Lefty's living in cheap hotelsThe desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold,And so the story ends we're told.Pancho needs your prayers it's true,But save a few for Lefty too.He only did what he had to do,And now he's growing old.All the Federales sayWe could have had him any day.We only let him go so longOut of kindness, I suppose.A few gray Federales sayWe could have had him any dayWe only let him go so longOut of kindness, I suppose.
Life is a picture and I play the lead but my biggest line was goodbyeNow my leading lady has walked out on me and this is the part where I criedI was great in the scene where she found someone newYou should have seen my look of surpriseAnd if you'll have just walk into the picture this is the part where I cryAnd after the picture is over and it's judged for the part where you liedThe award of the chief meant that's given will be mine for the part where I criedI was great in the scene...
Memories are haunting you And they're making you feel blueDarling a penny for your thoughtsAre you thinking of the past And a love that didn't lastDarling a penny for your thoughtsAnd it hurts me so to see the sorrow Written on your faceAnd I hope and pray that some tomorrow I can take his placeBut if someday we should part You can say a broken heartOffered a penny for your thoughtsAnd it hurts me so to see the sorrow Written on your faceAnd I hope and pray that some tomorrow I can take his placeBut if someday we should part You can say a broken heartOffered a penny for your thoughts
Don't be concerned it's time I learned That those who play with fire get burnedBut I'll be alright in a little while But you'll be permanently lonelyDon't be too quick to pity me Don't salve my heart with sympathy'Cause I'll be alright in a little while But you'll be permanently lonelyThe world looks on with wonder And pity at your kind'Cause it knows that the future Is not very pretty for your kind for your kindWill always be runnin' and wonderin' What's happened to hearts that you've broken And left all aloneBut we'll be alright in a little while But you'll be permanently lonely Runnin' lonely

I've been on the road most all of my life,Traveled from coast to coast.In search of some pleasures and treasures and things.Whatever pleased me the most.Like bandanas and blue jeans and old cowboy clothes,That bring back an old country song,About rough rides and red-eyes and old broken bones,And railroad tracks running back home. Put me on a train back to Texas.I've been where the highwaymen roam.Put me on a train back to Texas.Wake me up when we reach San Antone:Wake me up when we reach San Antone. Mamma says home's where the heart is,Like Bob Wills said in a poem.Well, my heart is there, in the middle of Texas,Beside the old Alamo.Like my broken-in saddle and old leather boots,I'm worn but I'm still going strong.Cowboys can tell when the seasons are changing,And I think it's time to move on. Put me on a train back to Texas.I've been where the highwaymen roam.Put me on a train back to Texas.Wake me up when we reach San AntoneWake me up when we reach San Antone.

There's a road runs clear to the sky,That calls to my spirit, calls to my heart.She's been a harbour, a port in a storm:She's got one more sundown, and one more dawn. Fiddles don't make violins.Motel rooms don't make homes.You can't turn water into wine.You can't make a rock from a rolling stone. You'd be a liar if you said you'd changed.There's a river of freedom runnin' through your veins.But she'll be there in your heart and your mind,'Til the last song fades, and the music dies. Fiddles don't make violins.Motel rooms don't make homes.You can't turn water into wine.You can't make a rock from a rolling stone. You can't make a rock from a rolling stone.
Roll me up and smoke me when I dieAnd if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eyeSay I didn't come here, and I ain't leavin'So don't sit around and cryJust roll me up and smoke me when I die. You won't see no sad and teary eyesWhen I get my wings and it's my time to flyJust call my friends and tell themThere's a party, come on byAnd just roll me up and smoke me when I die. Roll me up and smoke me when I dieAnd if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eyeSay I didn't come here, and I ain't leavin'So don't sit around and cryJust roll me up and smoke me when I die. Well just take me out and build a roaring fireAnd just roll me in the flames for about an hourAnd then pull me out and twist me upAnd point me towards the skyAnd roll me up and smoke me when I die. Roll me up and smoke me when I dieAnd if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eyeSay I didn't come here, and I ain't leavin'So don't sit around and cryJust roll me up and smoke me when I die. I didn't come here, and I ain't leavin'So don't sit around and cryJust roll me up and smoke me when I die.

He looked down into her brown eyes,Said, " Say a prayer for me."She threw her arms around him,Whispered, "God will keep us free."And they could hear the riders comin,He said, "This is my last fight.If they take me back to Texas,They won't take me back alive."**Chorus**And there were seven Spanish Angels,At the alter of the Sun.They were prayin' for the lovers,In the valley of the gun.And when the battle stopped,And the smoke cleared.There was thunder from the throne.And seven Spanish angels,Took another angel home.She reached down and picked the gun up,That lay smokin in his hand.Said, "Father please forgive me,I can't make it without my man."And she knew the gun was empty,And she knew she couldn't win.But her final prayer was answered,When the rifles fired again.**Chorus
Shall we gather at the river,Where bright angels he has brought,With it's crystal tides foreverFlowing by the throne of GodYes, we'll gather at the river.The beautiful, the beautiful, river.Gather with the saints at the river,That flows by the throne of GodEre we reach the shining riverLay we every burden down,Praise our spirits will deliverAnd provide our robe and crown.Yes, we'll gather at the river.The beautiful, the beautiful, river.Gather with the saints at the river,That flows by the throne of GodSoon we'll reach the shining river,Soon our pilgrimage will cease,Soon our happy hearts will quiverWith the melody of peace.Yes, we'll gather at the river.The beautiful, the beautiful, river.Gather with the saints at the river,That flows by the throne of God

Pay no mind to her She only wants to play But she's not for you She's not for youAnd I'm the only one Who would let her act this wayBut she's not for you She's not for youSo she told you she found Heaven in your eyesWell I think it only fair To warn you that Sometimes she liesBut it's your heart I can't tell you What to do But she's not for you She's not for youShe just looks for Greener pastures now and thenAnd when she grows tired She knows Old Faithful Will just take her back againSo just leave her here I'm used to feeling blue She's not for you She's not for youShe's not for you She's not for you
She's out of my life she's out of my lifeAnd I don't know whether to laugh or cryI don't know whether to live or dieAnd it cuts like a knife she's out of my lifeIt's out of my hands it's out of my handsTo think for two years she was hereAnd I took her for granted I was so cavalierNow the way that it stands she's out of my handsI have learned love is not possession and I have learned that love won't waitI have learned love needs expression but I learned too lateShe's out of my life she's out of my lifeDamned indecision and cursed prideKept my love for her locked deep insideAnd it cuts like a knife she's out of my life
I wake up in the morning with my arms around my pillowThen suddenly I realize I only hold a pillow you're not there you're not thereI call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallwayTo return alone confirming all I've known for so long I'm alone you're still goneStill half asleep I stumble to the kitchen for my coffeeMy footsteps match my heartbeats funny heartbeats on linoleumThe sounds all wrong you're still goneThe sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait foreverAnd understanding saves don't stand by empty gravesYou're on your own all alone she's still gone

Soft rain was falling when you told me goodbyeThunder and lightning filled my heart insideThe love born in heaven had suddenly diedAnd the soft rain was teardrops for the angels all criedIf love can be perfect ours must have beenBut perfection is always destroyed by menThe rain whispered softly a true love just diedAnd the soft rain was teardrops for the angels all criedThe rain started falling when you told me goodbyeAnd lightning came crashing from out of the skyThe sky that was bright blue turned slowly to greyAnd the angels cried with me as you walked awayIf love can be perfect ours must have been
Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,You may see a stranger across a crowded room,And somehow you know, you know even then,That somehow you'll see here again and again.Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,And night after night, as strange as it seems,The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.Who can explain it, who can tell you why?Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,When you hear her call you across a crowded room,Then fly to her side and make her your own,Or all through your life you may dream all alone.Once you have found her, never let her go,Once you have found her, never let her go.
Some other time, I'll forget you.And start my life anew.But not just now, I won't forget you,'Cause I've spent too much time loving you.I know I could forget you if I wanted to.But there's still ten thousand dreams that I must dream of you.Some other time, I'll stop rememberin',The love that came my way.Then I'll forget I ever loved you.Some other time, but not today.I know I could forget you if I wanted to.But there's still ten thousand dreams that I must dream of you.Some other time, I'll stop rememberin',The love that came my way.Then I'll forget I ever loved you.Some other time, but not today.

South of the border down Mexico wayThat's where I fell in love when stars above came out to playNow as I wander my thoughts ever stray south of the border down Mexico wayShe was a picture in old Spanish laceAnd for a tender while I kissed the smile opon her faceFor it was Fiesta we were so gay south of the border down Mexico wayAnd she smiled and she whispered MananaNever dreaming that we were partingAnd I lied and I whispered Manana for our tomorrow never cameSouth of the border I rode back one dayThere in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to prayAnd the mission bells told me that I mustn't staySouth of the border down Mexico wayAy ay ay ay ay ay ay ayAy ay ay ay ay ay ay ay

I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did rideWith sword and pistol by my sideMany a young maid lost her baubles to my tradeMany a soldier shed his lifeblood on my bladeThe bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-fiveBut I am still aliveI was a sailor. I was born upon the tideAnd with the sea I did abideI sailed a schooner round the Horn to MexicoI went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blowAnd when the yards broke off they said that I got killedBut I am living stillI was a dam builder across the river deep and wideWhere steel and water did collideA place called Boulder on the wild ColoradoI slipped and fell into the wet concrete belowThey buried me in that great tomb that knows no soundBut I am still aroundI'll always be around and around and aroundAnd around and aroundI fly a starship across the Universe divideAnd when I reach the other sideI'll find a place to rest my spirit if I canPerhaps I may become a highwayman againOr I may simply be a single drop of rainBut I will remain and I'll be back againAnd again and again and again and again
Stardust   ?[]  Willie Nelson   Sometimes I wounder  Why I spend the lonely night  Dreaming of a song  The melody haunts my memory  And I am once again you  When our love is new  And each kiss an inspiration   But that was long ago  And now my consolation  Is in star dust of sun  Beside the garden wall  When stars are bright  You are in arms  The nightingale tells his fairy tales  Of paradise where roses grow   *Though I dream them in my heart  They always will remain  My stardust memory  The memory of loves refrain   And though I dream in vain  In my heart it will always will remain  My stardust memory  The memory of loves refrain   (Repeat *)

All the years combine, they melt into a dream,A broken angel sings from a guitar.In the end there's just a song comes cryin' up the nightThru all the broken dreams and vanished years.Stella blue. Stella blue.When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see,There's just the pavement left and broken dreams.In the end there's still that song comes cryin' like the wind.Down every lonely street that's ever beenStella blue. Stella blue.I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying.Dust off those rusty strings just one more time,Gonna make them shine, shineIt all rolls into one and nothing comes for free,There's nothing you can hold, for very long.And when you hear that song come crying like the wind,It seems like all this life was just a dream.Stella blue. Stella blue

On a Sunday morning sidewalk I'm wishing Lord that I was stonedCause there's something in a Sunday makes a body feel aloneAnd there's nothing sure to dying half as lonesome as the soundOn a sleepy city sidewalk Sunday morning coming downWell I woke up Sunday morning with no way to hold my head that didn't hurtAnd the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad so I had one more for desertThen I fumbled through my closet for my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirtAnd I shaved my face and combed my hairAnd stumbled down the stair to meet the dayI'd smoke my brain the night before with cigarettes and songs I'd been a pickingBut I lit my first and watched the small kid cussin' at a can that he was kickingThen I crossed the empty street and caughtThe Sunday smell of someone fryin' chickenAnd it took me back to something that I'd lost somewhere somehow along the wayOn a Sunday morning sidewalkIn the park I saw a daddy with the laughing little girl that he was swingingAnd I stopped beside a Sunday school and listened to the songs they were singingThen I headed back for home and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringingAnd it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterdayOn a Sunday morning sidewalkComing down coming down coming down coming down

Sweet dreams of you dreams I know can't come trueWhy can't I forget the past start loving someone newInstead of having sweet dreams about you sweet dreams about youYou don't love me it's plain I should know you'd never wear my nameI should hate you the whole night throughInstead of having sweet dreams about you[ guitar ]You don't love me it's plain I should know you'd never never wear my nameAnd I should hate you the whole night throughInstead of having sweet dreams about youInstead of having sweet dreams about you

My world is like a river as dark as it is deepNight after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleepMy days are just an endless stream of emptiness to meFilled only by the fleeting moments of her memoriesSweet memories sweet memories hmmShe slipped into the silence of my dreams last nightWondering from room to room turning on each lightHer laughter spills like water from the river to the seaAnd I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memoriesSweet memories sweet memories hmm

Within my prison cell so dreary Alone I sit alone with aching heartI'm dreaming of my little darling From her forever I must partThe rose she sent me as a token She sent it just to light my gloomAnd tell me that her heart is broken And cheer me before I meet my doomThe judge would not believe my story The jury said I have to payAnd with the rose in all its glory Not guilty's all that I could sayGoodbye sweetheart for in the morning To meet my Maker I must goAnd when I die at daylight's dawning Against my heart they'll find this roseWithin my prison cell so dreary...
The silence is unusually loud tonight The strange sound of nothing fills my earsThe night rushes in like a crowd of nights And the ghost of our old love goes awayThis strange world of darkness That comes with the nightGrows darker when it walks my wayAnd it lasts while I listen For the breaking of dayAnd the ghost of our old love goes awayThis strange world of darknessAnd the ghost of our old love goes away
People sit around and they talk and talk,How their dreams all ended too soon.Guess they never hung out under the stars,Howlin' at the moon.I guess we're as different and nine and eight,I see it in a different light.I don't think much about the good ol' days,Just about the good ol' nights.Talk about the good times,Talk about the times when the times were right.You can keep the good ol' days,I'll take the good ol' nights.They wanna go back to when a Cadillac,Didn't look like a Chevrolet.It mean't a lot to them but not a thing to me,I never owned one anyway.But a good lookin' woman and an old guitar,With both of them tuned just right.Well I don't think much about the good ol' days,Just about the good ol' nights.Talk about the good times,Talk about the times when the times were right.You can keep the good ol' days,I'll take the good ol' nights.You can keep the good ol' days,I'll take the good ol' nights.

If I had the heart of a clown I'd laugh every time you made me blueIf I had the heart of a clown You wouldn't see me cry the way you doAnd I'd paint a smile upon my face Each time you hurt me soMy arms could long for your embrace But you would never knowAnd I'd sing as my dream world tumbled down If I had the heart of a clownAnd I'd paint a smile upon my face Each time you hurt me soMy arms could long for your embrace But you would never knowAnd I'd sing as my dream world tumbled down If I had the heart of a clown
I drove in on the four laneWhere the two lane used to beThe highway hummed a near forgotten tuneFrom 1963The year I turned 18 and set my sights And heard the highway callNow the highway's come full circleTo a place I scarce recall There's a girl I still rememberWhose name I can't recallI gave her what I had, but thenShe tried to take it allI stayed long enough to love herAnd then left her on the runLike a flower left to witherIn that deep East Texas sun There's a place out on the highwayWhere I go to spend my timeWhere the bartenders all know meAnd the players are friends of mineAnd we light up on the brakesAnd talk of things that we all knowBut I've heard it all beforeAnd I'll hear it all againAnd I've heard it saidThe highway never ends So what about old handsome JohnnyAnd the class of '64?Did the women all make promisesWhen they shipped him off to war?Did his mama get the medalAnd did his country ever win?Well, let's drink a round to Johnny'Cuz he died for all our sins. They're still down there in the factoriesYou can see 'em in the millsThey've sweated there for years, LordI guess they always will.And you know they won't be leavingAnd I can't watch 'em die that waySo in my rear view mirrorI'll just watch them slip away There's a place out on the highwayWhere I go to spend my timeWhere the bartenders all know meAnd the players are friends of mineAnd we light up on the brakesAnd talk of things that we all knowBut I've heard it all beforeAnd I'll hear it all againAnd I've heard it saidThe highway never ends The highway never endsThe highway never ends
Turn out the lights The party's over They say that All good things must endCall it tonight The party's over And tomorrow starts The same old thing againBut the crazy crazy party Never seen so many peopleLaughing dancing Look at you you're having funBut look at me I'm almost cryin' That don't keep her love from dyin'Misery cause for me the party's overTurn out the lights...Once I had a love undyin' I didn't keep it but I triedLife for me was just one party And then anotherI broke her heart so many times I had to have my parting wifeI had to have my party Why broke her heart so many timesBut one day she said Sweetheart the party's overTurn out the lights...
See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeansWearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smileOnce he had a future full of money love and dreamsWhich he spent like they was going out of styleAnd he keeps right on a changin' for the better or the worseAnd searchin' for a shrine he's never foundNever knowing if believin' is a blessin' or a curseOr if the going up is worth to coming downHe's a poet he's a picker he's a prophet he's a pusherHe's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stonedHe's a walking contradiction partly truth and partly fictionTaking every wrong direction on his lonely way back homeHe has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your barsAnd he's traded in tomorrow for todayRunnin' from the devils Lord and reachin' for the starsAnd losin' all he loved along the wayBut if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worseAnd all he ever gets is older and aroundFrom the rocking of the cradle to the rolling of the hearseThe going up was worth the coming downHe's a poet he's a picker...[ guitar ]
When ever we kiss,I worry and wonder.Your lips may be near,but where is your heart?It's always like this,I worry and wonder.You're close to me here,but where is your heart?It's a sad thing to realize that you've a heart that never melts.When we kiss, do you close your eyes,pretending that I'm someone else?You must break the spell,this cloud that I'm under.So please won't you tell, darling,where is your heart?
Well I've been feeling a little bad Cause I've been feeling a little better without youIt's a little like rain but it's a lot like a sunny dayAnd it's hard to explain but the sound of your name don't make music anymoreIt's more than a sound of a love that I lost one dayIt's a little too late to start thinking about startin' all overI'd rather stay where I am I can't take another slam in the mindI've been feeling a little bad cause I've been feeling a little better without youBut remember my love is the sound that you hear in your mindI've been running around even laughing at half of the memoriesAnd you're not hard to remember I just have to think of your nameI've been feeling a little bad...And remember my love it's the sound that you hear in your mind

I could tell the moment that I saw himHe was nothing but the trouble making kindHis hair was much too long and his motley group of friends Had nothing but rebellion on their mindsHe's rejected the establishment completely And I know for sure He's never held a jobHe just goes from town to townStirring up the young folks'Til they're nothing but a disrespectful mobAnd I know for sure He's never joined the army And served His country like we all have doneHe'd rather wear His sandals and His flowersWhile others wage the war that must be won.They arrested Him last week and found Him guiltyAnd sentenced Him to die but that's no great lossFriday they will take Him to a place called Calvary And hang that troublemaker to a crossMmmmmmHmm...
Put some money in the jukebox and let it playFor my heart is cold with its painTake the cork from the bottle of a warm red wineAnd fill my glass up, againFill my glass to the brim till it flows over the rimLike the tears flow in this heart of mineWhile I'll sail so long to the dreams that are goneOn account of the warm red wineOh, the prison of stone with its cold iron barsIs no more than a prison than mineI'm a prisoner of drink who will never escapeFrom the chains of the warm red wineOh, the wine is red, so warm and redLike a ruby, it sparkles and gleamsBut I paid for the wine, the one red wineWith all of my hopes and dreams

There goes a man Who gave his heart to someone And I feel sorry for himFor that someone Just gave her heart to meNow he's the loser And it hurts so much to lose And I feel sorry for himCause the loser I know Could have been meOh how he loved her I'm sure he must have loved her Almost as much as meBut fate has frowned on him Then turned around and smiled on meThere goes a man Who gave his heart to someone And I feel sorry for himFor that someone Just gave her heart to meIf things were different And if he had won Her love instead of meI wonder if he'd find the time To offer sympathyThere goes a man Who gave his heart to someone And I feel sorry for him Cause that someone Just gave her heart to me

He was tougher than leather And he didn't care whether The sun shined or notWhen a young kid in Cow Town Wanted a showdownHe was careless or just maybe forgotBut he died in the gunfight Blinded by sunlight Never draw when you're facin' the sunAnd old tougher than leather Just carved one more notch on his gunAnd when he turned to go The beautiful maiden knelt downWhere her dead sweetheart layAnd on his breast placed a rose While the townspeople stared in dismayAnd old tougher than leather Should've known betterBut he picked up the rose in his handAnd the townspeople froze When his hands crushed the roseAnd the rose petals fell in the sandAnd old tougher than leather Was a full-time go-getterThe grass never grew beneath his feetFrom one town to another He would ride like the windBut his mind kept going back to the streetWhere a young cowboy died And a young maiden criedAnd rose petals fell in the sandAnd his heart had been softened By the beautiful maidAnd he knew he must see her againWell he went back to the town Where it all had come downAnd he searched but his search was in vainHe had wanted to find herAnd say he was sorryFor causing her heart so much painBut one night he died from a poison insideBrought on by the wrong he had doneAnd old tougher than leather Had carved his last notch on his gunWell he was burried in Cow Town Along about sundownLookin' good in his new store-bought clothesWhen the young maiden came over And knelt down beside himAnd on his lapel placed a roseThere's a bird in the sky Flying high, flying highTo a place from a place Changing skies, changing skies
I'm gonna lay my head on some lonesome railroad lineAnd let that old two-twenty pacify mindYeah I'm goin' down to the river I'm gonna take me a rockin' chairYeah honey if these blues don't get me I'm gonna rock away from hereWell trouble in mind I'm blue but I won't be blue alwaysBefore the sun's gonna shine in my backyard one of these daysTrouble in mind that's true I've almost almost lost my mindSometimes I feel like livin' sometimes I feel like dyin'Well trouble in mind I'm blue...
He's a sad song singer, he plays a gut-stringerWith vagabond fingers,that follow his mindTo far away places, he reaches for tracesAnd touches the faces, he's long left behindHe'll keep you from knowing, where he's been, or goingBut you'll see the distance, right there in his eyesAn, just short of stealing, he'll take your feelingsPull at your heart strings, 'til they come untiedThere once was a woman who made him turn lonesomeHer memory turns over and over againHe's like an old stallion who's longing for freedomTryin' to outrun the windWell, I've laughed with the sunshine, an' cried with the rainsI've had some bad nights, with the best of the bluesAn' I go on pretending, with long-haired womenBut I still get crazy when I think of youThere once was a woman who made him turn lonesomeHer memory turns over and over againHe's like an old stallion who's longing for freedomTryin' to outrun the windHe's like an old stallion who's longing for freedomTryin' to outrun the wind
I'm a roaming cowboy, riding all day longTumbleweeds around me sing their lonely songNights underneath the prairie moonI ride along and sing this tune See them tumbling downPledging their love to the groundLonely but free I'll be foundDrifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds Cares of the past are behindNowhere to go but I'll findJust where the trail will windDrifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds I know when night has goneThat a new world's born at dawn I'll keep rolling alongDeep in my heart is a songHere on the range I belongDrifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Heavenly shades of night are falling it's twilight timeOut of the mist your voice is calling it's twilight timeWhen purple colored curtain mark the end of dayHear you my dear at twilight timeDeepening shadows gather splendor as day is doneFingers of night will soon surrender the setting sunI count the moments darling till you're here with meTogether at last at twilight timeHere in the afterglow of day we keep your rendezvous beneath the blueHere in the sweet and same old day fall in love again as I did thenDeep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like days of oldLighting the spark of love that fills me with dreams untoldEach day I pray for evening just to be with you together at last at twilight timeDeep in the darkTogether at last at twilight time
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,How I wonder what you are.Up above the world so high,Like a diamond in the sky.Twinkle, twinkle, little star,How I wonder what you are!When the blazing sun is gone,When he nothing shines upon,Then you show your little light,Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.Twinkle, twinkle, little star,How I wonder what you are!Then the traveler in the darkThanks you for your tiny spark;He could not see which way to go,If you did not twinkle so.Twinkle, twinkle, little star,How I wonder what you are!In the dark blue sky you keep,While you thro' my window peep,And you never shut your eye,Till the sun is in the sky,Twinkle, twinkle, little star,How I wonder what you are!
You load the horses, I'll pack the rigger.Let's tell 'em goodbye and walk out the door.One kiss and one drink can lead to too many.We ought to know cause we been there before.Eight hours of riding will put us in Houston.Two hours of sleep to make it or bust.Eight seconds of glory, you stay in the money,And five year old whiskey to wash down the dust.That ain't no hill for a couple of climbers,That's all we ever intended to be.That ain't no hill for a couple of climbers,Two old sidewinders like you and me.Let's find us a place and a couple of ladies.Someone to lie to, someone to trust.Someone who's impressed by a couple of outlaws.Who's gold plated trophies have turned into rust.Now we're damned near broke, and we keep buying whiskey.Do you think they might settle for a bottle of wine?Well those two over there, right there by the jukebox.Yours don't look back, Hoss, but just look at mine.That ain't no hill for a couple of climbers,That's all we ever intended to be.That ain't no hill for a couple of climbersTwo old sidewinders like you and me.

Soft as the voice of an angel,Breathing a lesson unheard,Hope with a gentle persuasionWhispers her comforting word:Wait till the darkness is over,Wait till the tempest is done,Hope for the sunshine tomorrow,After the shower is gone.Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice,Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.If, in the dusk of the twilight,Dim be the region afar,Will not the deepening darknessBrighten the glimmering star?Then when the night is upon us,Why should the heart sink away?When the dark midnight is over,Watch for the breaking of day.Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice,Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.Hope, as an anchor so steadfast,Rends the dark veil for the soul,Whither the Master has entered,Robbing the grave of its goal.Come then, O come, glad fruition,Come to my sad weary heart;Come, O Thou blest hope of glory,Never, O never depart.Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice,Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to knowWhere the treetops glisten and children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snowI'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I writeMay your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be whiteI'm dreaming of a white Christmas...May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white

Without a song, the day would never end Without a song, the road would never bend When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend Without a song! That field of corn, would never see a plough That field of corn, would be deserted now A young one's born, but he's no good no how Without a song! I got my trouble an' woe, but sure as I know The Jordan will roll ( Roll you river Jordan! ) I'll get along as long as a song is strungIn my soul! I'll never know what makes the rain to fall, I'll never know what makes the grass so tall, I only know there ain't no love at all Without a song!

She thinks if she just holds on he will get it back togetherOn his good days he's a good man and he fills up all her dreamsOn his bad days he's the devil and it's hell to stand beside himBut she thinks if she will love him life will be what once it seemedWomen who love too much burning fires they have to touchGive until there's nothing left to give use up life to help men liveWomen who love too much just can't leave the dark aloneFall in love with the unknown they will go until they're goneHe knows he loves too little and he takes her in his knowingOn the bad days when he needs her she's the best hope that he's hadAnd he knows that he's the weak one and he doesn't want to know itAnd he holds on to her loving though he knows it's all so sadWomen who love too much...Women who love too much...

Today, I stood across the street an' watched you leave with him,Right before my disbelieving eyes.And when you saw me standing there, you turned away from me.And you wouldn't even cross the street to say goodbye. Once you said you'd do most anything to keep our love.You'd tear out your tongue before you'd tell me lies.Once you said you'd go to any lengths to be with me.Today, you wouldn't even cross the street to say goodbye. Instrumental break. Once you said you'd do most anything to keep our love.You'd tear out your tongue before you'd tell me lies.Once you said you'd crawl on hands and knees to be with me.Today, you wouldn't even cross the street to say goodbye.
Today, I stood across the street and watched you leave with him.Right before my disbelieving eyes.And when you saw me standing there, you turned away from me.And you wouldn't even cross the street to say goodbye. [Chorus x2]Once you said you'd do most anything to keep our love.You'd tear out your tongue before you'd tell me lies.Once you said you'd go to any lengths to be with me.Today, you wouldn't even cross the street to say goodbye.
Discontent you must be  Leaving love leaving me  So go wait for your dreams to come true  But should young dreams grow old  And warm friendships grow cold  There'll be someone waiting for you  And if you ever find that fate is unkind  And the devil starts taking his dues  When your fair weather friends  Leave when fair weather ends  There'll be someone waiting for you  You'll always have someone who loves you  You're never alone, don't you see  And when your world's slowing down  You'll need someone around  Let that someone always be me
You'll never know just how much I love youYou'll never know just how much I careAnd if I tried I still couldn't hide my love for youYou ought to know for heaven I told you soA million or more timesYou went away and my heart went with youI speak your name in my every prayerIf there is some other way to prove that I love youI swear I don't know howYou'll never know if you don't know nowYou went away and my heart went with youI speak your name in my every prayerIf there is some other way to prove that I love youI swear I don't know howYou'll never know if you don't know now
Been feelin' kind of free But I sure do feel lonesome Baby's takin' a trip But she ain't takin' me I've been feelin' kinda free But I'd rather feel your arms around me 'Cause you're takin' away Ev'rything that I wanted There's an old hollow tree Where we carved our initials And I said I love you And you said you love me It's a mem'ry today It'll be a mem'ry tomorrow I hope you'll be happy someday (And) Your mem'ry won't die in my grave
You're not mine anymore But I'm still paying forJust a note from you to say You've changed your mindNow I know you say we're through But I'm still in love with youAnd it's my fault That you're not mine anymoreIf you don't ever change your mind To take me back againI hope you meet someone that's true And fall in love with himSince the day you said we're through I'm even more in love with youAnd it's my fault That you're not mine anymore[ steel - guitar ]If you don't ever change your mind To take me back againI hope you meet someone that's true And fall in love with himSince the day you said we're through I'm even more in love with youAnd it's my fault That you're not mine anymore
May the Lord's shining grace be yours, love May the happiest face be yours, loveMay the last fingertips That touch these two lips As life from me slips be yours, loveMay the fruit of my toil be yours, love May the food from my soil be yours loveAnd from this moment on May a love that is strong And lives on and on be yours, loveMay the sons that I raise be yours, love May the comforts that I praise be yours, loveAnd if I ever get weak May the love words I speakAnd the arms that I seek be yours, loveMay the Lord's shining grace...May the Lord's shining grace...
Well it's four a.m. and you're just gettin' inYour first night out and I won't ask you where you've beenYou're so ashamed and your eyes just can't meet mineYou've seen that look on me a thousand timesWhat makes us do the things we do heaven only knowsWe think we have a secret but it always showsAnd I taught you how to cheat you're doing fineYou've seen that look on me a thousand timesBut I still love you and so I pretend and hope I'll never see that look againBut if we do I know the fault is mine I've seen that look on me a thousand timesI've seen that look on me a thousand times
