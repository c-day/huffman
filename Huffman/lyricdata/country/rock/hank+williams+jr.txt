She's is pretty as she can be and got a beautiful body,  and when she makes love to me I can't help but hollar A-EEE!  They say that I'm a crazy cajun always rantin' and a ravin'.   But they don't know what they're missing if they ain't never had her kissin'.  In the car or in the shower I'm thinkin' of every hour  and sometimes I get this urge to just hollar 'cause I love her.  I jumped up in a bar one night when I was feeling alright.  Let out a great big A-EEE and the sheriff said come with me.  Well he threw me into the jail I guess he didn't like my Louisiana yell,  but a man come and bailed me out and said in his mind there was no doubt.  That I could be a big star probably get myself a brand new car.  I says you mean your going to pay me just to hear me hollar A-eee!  Yes he said thats right son!We're gonna make a million.  So we went to Nashville town.I made a record and it played all around.  From then on they were Number 1,but I wasn't having no fun.  I miss my Cajun Baby and all that good A-eee!  So I went on back to Louisian' to find my girl and have a love again,  'cause after all she's the one you see that made it all happen to me.  She's my soul and inspiration and soon her love I'll be tasting.  Oh she's drivin' me crazy with all of her A-eee!  She's got soft finger tips and a warm red ruby lips.  Well she's 24 in the waste and 36 and 38  and she's as pretty as she can be.She's got a beautiful body  and thats all that matters to me. Me and my baby and A-eee!
I was getting kinda tiredOf her endless chatterNothing I could sayEver seemed to matterSo I took a little driveJust to clear my headI saw a flashing neon, up aheadIt looked like a placeTo find some satisfactionWith a little less talkAnd a lot more actionI paid the man at the doorAnd pushed my way to the barShouted for a drinkOver a screaming guitarA drunk on a stoolTried to mess with my headBut I didn't even listenTo a word he saidI knew somewhereAmid all this distractionWas a little less talkAnd a lot more actionA little less talkIf you pleaseA lot more lovingIs what I needLet's get on downTo the main attractionWith a little less talkAnd a lot more actionWell she was fighting them offAt a corner tableShe had a longneck bottleShe was peeling the labelThe look on her faceIt was perfectly clearShe said, somebody pleaseGet me, out of hereThe look she shot meThrough the glass refractionSaid a little less talkAnd a lot more actionA little less talkIf you pleaseA lot more lovingIs what I needLet's get on downTo the main attractionWith a little less talkAnd a lot more action
Tonight down here in the valleyI'm lonesome and O how I feelAs I sit here alone in my cabinI can see your mansion on the hillDo you recall when we partedThe story to me you revealedYou said you could live without lovingIn your loveless mansion on the hillI've waited all through the years loveTo give you a heart true and realCause I know you're living in sorrowIn your loveless mansion on the hillThe light shine bright from yer windowThe trees stand so silent and stillI know you're alone with your pride dearIn your loveless mansion on the hill
Hoverin' by my suitcaseTryin' to find a warm place to spend the nightA heavy rain a fallin' seemsI hear your voice a callin' it's all rightOn this rainy night in GeorgiaA rainy night in Georgia I believe it's rainin' all over the worldNeon signs a flashin' taxicabs and busesPassin' through the nightThe distant moanin' of a trainSeems to play a sad refrain onto the nightOn this rainy night in GeorgiaSuch a rainy night in Georgia I think, it's rainin' all over the worldHow many times I have wonderedBut it always comes out the sameNo matter how I look at it'll think about itIt's just like some of its pleasuresSome of its pain I find me a place in a boxcarSo I take out my guitar to pass some timeLate at night when it's hard to restI hold your picture to my chestAnd then I'm all rightBut it's still a rainy night in GeorgiaIt's a rainy night in Georgia I believe it must be rainin' all over this worldAll over the world rainy night in Georgia
I guess I'll get a cab and go by in my house todayNo I can't visit her or my son I'm supposed to stay awayBut it won't hurt to bring back old memoriesCause after all they used to all belong to meNow there's our car the one that I'm still payin' forAnd in the front yard Lord I see my little boyAnd there's his mother I hope she's doing fineOh Lord I'd give anything if they were all still mineBut they're not and I'm the one to blameI should have known I'd never win when I played that cheating gameThis other man holds my life and my son calls him daddy tonightBut how can I complain cause after all they used to all belong to meHow can I complain cause after all they used to all belong to me

Morning comes and spreads tomorrow on my bed so softlyI can feel the darkness growLeaving like the girl who walked across my worldAnd took the only love I'll ever knowShe was all I wanted but I guess I never told her now she's gone awayIf I had a wish my only wish would be that she was coming back to stayAll I had to do to hold her was hold herI was always looking out for meAnd only thought about all the things I had to doAll I did was turn away when all she wanted me to say was I love you[ strings ]Evening starts to spread across my lonely bed so slowlyI can feel the darkness growShadows bring the gloom that fills my silent roomWith sounds of someone cryin' lowI close my eyes and memorize the softness of her lips on my ownWhat's the point in being strong or being right or wrongThat point means as being aloneAll I had to do to hold her was hold herAll I had to do to hold her was hold her

I went down to the river to watch the fish swim byBut I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die, oh Lord!And then I jumped in the river, but the river was dry.He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.I had me a man who couldn't be true.He made me for my money and she made me blue.A woman needs a man that he can lean on,But my leanin' post is done left and gone.He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice.And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, Oh Lord!I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice.He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.He told me on Sunday he was checkin' me out,Long about Monday he was nowhere about.And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news.I got them gone but not forgotten blues.He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.
Well, I ain't been home for so doggone longI almost forgot where I come fromAin't got no money but I still ain't a bumI'm almost nearly but not quite plumb A back last summer down by the seaI seen a pretty girl inI snapped my fingers, said son of a gunShe's almost nearly but not quite plumb Some people wonder how I liveSometimes I pick, sometimes I givePeople say I'm a bumI'm almost nearly but not quite plumb I met a pretty girl up in ChicagoShe said, honey baby, I love you soShe begged me to stay and not act like a bumI've been almost nearly but not quite plumb Friends ask me why I don't take a wifeSettle down to a married lifeThey say it's good as most and it's better than someI say I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb Some people wonder how I live Just the other night out in TucsonI had a little date with a great big blondeI took her home, she said didn't we have funHmm, almost nearly but not quite plumb When it's time for the final date withOld Saint Pete's at the pearly gateHe'll say I hope you're ready for your time's comeI'll say I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb Some people wonder how I live
Now this ain't no cheating song, cause I didn't do nothingLast night all alone in a honky tonk barroomI met a girl with a drink of beam in her handShe had ruby red lips and coal black, black hairAnd eyes that would tempt any honky tonk manThen she came and sat down at my tableAnd as she placed her soft hands in mineI found myself wanting to kiss herFor temptation was flowing like cheap honky tonk wine And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my prideAlmost persuaded to push my conscience aside Then we danced and she whispered I need youTake me away from here and be my big ol' southern manThen I looked into her eyes and I saw that look andI saw something else the reflection of my wedding band And I was almost persuaded to stip myself of my prideAlmost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home That was really hard to do
The evening is lonesome babe,And the dead of night is cruel.And I recall all the things we done.Ya know I'm always loving you.Sometimes I think that my trains done gone.The way all old things must do.Yet I still wait for it's return,Just like I still wait for you.And I still hear that old whipperwill.I've seen the ghost of the midnight train.And I still love to walk alone,Down by the old union station in the rain.Now I don't know where you are tonight,But I feel you across the miles.Am I still standing there inside your mind,Just behind a pretty smile.Hey babe, can ya hear that old whipperwill?Have ya seen the ghost on the midnight train?Do you still love to go alone,Down by the old union station in the rain?Down by the old Montgomery station in the rain.

Where is the love that we once knewThere were no hang-ups between me and youWhere are the words we use to speakBefore you fell out of love with me Where's the good loving you use to giveAlone is a bad bad way to liveArms so soft, lips so sweetBefore you fell out of love with me Where are the walks we use to takeWhere are the plans we use to makeWhere are the dreams we use to dreamBefore you fell out of love with me Where are the laughs use to haveWhy did the good times turn into the badWhere are the mornings we use to seeBefore you fell out of love with me Where are the nights we'd stay awakeWhere is the love we use to makeWhere's your body so eager and freeBefore you fell out of love with me I was just thinnking how life use to beBefore you fell out of love with me
Well I've seen the devilAnd I've seen the lightAnd I know the differenceBetween wrong and rightBut there still are timesWhen it's so hard to tellIf I'm going the wrong wayTo heaven or hell Cause I've been a sinnerAnd I've been a saintThere's a few things I ain't doneAnd a few things I can'tI was this close to heaven when I slipped and fellBetween a rock and a hard placeBetween heaven and hell Cause I have been lostAnd I have been foundI've been a squareAnd I've been aroundI'm down on my kneesAt the heartbreak hotelBegging for directionsBetween heaven and hell Cause I've been a sinnerAnd I've been a saintThere's a few things I ain't doneAnd a few things I can'tI was this close to heaven when I slipped and fellBetween a rock and a hard placeBetween heaven and hell Lord I'm down here on my kneesAt some old hotelAsking for directionsTo heaven or hell

When you pack your clothes tonight don't pack up all the blame. Your not the first to walk away and leave someone in pain. I know how much its hurting you, hurting me this way. Believe me I've been in your shoes and I know you can't stay.   I've been on both sides of goodbye. I know there ain't no easy side. I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time. I've been on both sides of goodbye.   Don't feel so bad for doing what you've got to do. You can't make your heart love me if it don't want to. When love just don't work both ways and someones got to go. So close that door and don't look back, believe me girl I know.   I've been on both sides of goodbye and I know there ain't no easy ride. I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time. I've been on both sides of goodbye. I've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time I've been on both sides of goodbye, goodbye!
I got a rock in my shoe, my jeans are cuttin' me in two, My underwear's too tight, my clothes don't ever fit right.My collar's so tight it's poppin' my veins, We walk around in constant pain.When I get home from work, I usually start with my shirt, I leave a trail behind, when I undress I unwind.I like to let it all hang out, Hey don't you know what I'm talkin' about, It feels so good to get buck naked, that ain't no sin, Buck naked wearin' my skinny skin skin.Buck naked in my birthday suit, Buck naked and I don't give a hoot, Buck naked like a centerfold, Buck naked is the way to go.I joined a nudist colony, they make me green with envy,  They spend no money on clothes, they got their own dress code, They walk around au natural, no more expensive dry cleaning bills, They just like to get, buck naked, swimmin' on the beach, Buck naked they're so squeaky clean, Buck naked in their birthday suits, Buck naked now ain't they cute, Buck naked there's a sunworshipper said, Buck naked what you see's what you get.My girl said you don't know how it feels, To walk around in panty hose and high heels, You oughta try to wear a bra all day, You don't know the price a girl's gotta pay.We wear our clothes so tight weCan't move, she said you don't know what a woman goes through, It feels so good to get buck naked like Adam & Eve.Buck naked like the monkeys in the trees, Buck naked like Tarzan and Jane, Buck naked no more high fashion pain.Buck naked like a centerfold, Buck naked is the way to go.

Oh the clock here in the barroom says its half past nine. That's usually how long it takes me to drink my first bottle of wine. Yes every fifteen minutes, I can drink another bottle down And get fifteen minutes closer to that cold,cold ground, to that cold cold ground. Well I think I'll play the jukebox and light up another cigarette They say for every puff of that loving smoke you get another minute closer to death. Well I smoke two or three packs a day and my arithmetic is not to sound. But I know I'm getting hours closer to that cold,cold ground. To that cold, cold ground. Now this morning I had me a woman and a love so nice and fine. But this evening I watched her board that train and move on down the line. Our love was so good but now she's gone and this is what I've found. Her leaving sure brought me closer to that cold, cold ground. To that cold, cold ground. Well I'm standing in the back alley with a pistol in my hand. I never thought a women's love could do this to a man. I hear that hammer clickin',what a sweet, terrible sound. Let my tombstone read "no liquor, no smoke, no drugs, But a woman's love put me in that cold, cold ground.Put me in that cold, cold ground.
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream.Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil schemeA memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apartWhy can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heartAnother love before my time made your heart sad and blueAnd so my heart is paying now for things I didn't doIn anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops startWhy can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heartYou'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cryYou know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to tryWhy do you run and hide from lies, to try it just ain't smartWhy can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart There was a time when I believed that you belonged to meBut now I know your heart is shackled to a memoryThe more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apartWhy can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart?

It was colder than a well digger's ankles in Cutbank, Montana.But my heart was on fire as I saw her step down from the train.I'd been up there forever, but her arms were finally around me.All my icicles melted away at the sound of her name.I held her to me as tightly as I held her letter,That said "I don't love him. I'm leaving this cold mean man."As the train pulled away from the platformAnd I put her in the wagon,With her head on my shoulder, God knows I was one happy man.And I went to heaven that night in her arms in my cabin.In the winter of '94 there burned such a powerful flame.They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank, Montana.And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name.Hell rode into town one night on a Wyoming stallion.His heart full of hate and his eyes full of cold jealousy."One way or another," he said,"partner, I'm taking back my woman."With my hand on my gun, I said, "Don't bet your life.The lady says she's staying with me."His knife was a flash in the light of the kerosene lanternThat fell as we tangled and fought in the fire on the floor.He was a dead man, but I have been too since I lost her.From the fire that burned me so bad as I crawled through the door.But I went to heaven that night in her arms in my little cabin.In the winter of '94, there burned one hell of a flame.They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank, Montana.And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name.They still hear her voice from the cabin in Cutbank, Montana,And the icicles all just melt away at the sound of her name.
I got some sun tan oilAnd a rebel flagStuck a Florida road mapIn my saddle bagI think Panama CityWould be a good place to startOn this little vacationTo loosen up my heartOrange blossom trailOver in OrlandoI've heard some wild tales about the women there standing out on the roadAnd when you leave out of thereOn a midnight rideTake that highway down to that famous town on the ocean side Daytona nightsThey make you danceAll the girls got that centerfold poseAnd they all got a tanAnd if they're looking for loveIt's like a rising tideAnd they will swallow you up like sand to the hubs, daytona nights Now the Boothill SaloonAnd the Last ResortThat's a few of the sitesYou need to be looking forHawaian tropic womenThey got the best buns of allI like the way they sway when they walk up and say, "hey and how are y'all"So we swim all dayAnd we played all nightAnd I never want to leave this free as a breeze, daytona nights Daytona nightsSure make you daneAll these girls got that centerfold poseAnd they all got a tanAnd if they're looking for loveIt's like a rising tideThey will swallow you up like sand to the hubs, daytona nights Yes if they're looking for loveIt's like a stormy tideThey will swallow you up like sand to the hubs, daytona nightsStuck in those daytona nights Here comes the tide

Every guy I know says women are too damn particular.Women talk and they expect the man to be a listener.They wanna walk while holdin' hands and whisper I love you.They need a combination Casanova Donahue.The men pull up in foreign cars, and drop there little women off.I serve'm frozen daqueries, while sugar daddys playin' golf.The heroes from the golfin' wars return and holler scotch.The ladies slip there rings back on. I'm in a diamond they're not hard to find.When I dig a little deeper, and take my time.They sparkle and they shine, precoius jewels of every kind.I'm just stealin' from the blind, I'm in a diamond mine. The big shots at the country club all act like I'm invisable.They never see me treet their women like they're irresitable.They think that I don't have a clue about the way things are, I hope the leave me in the dark.(Repeat 2) twice

The night was black, rain falling downLook for my baby, she's nowhere aroundTraced her footsteps down to the shoreAfraid she's gone for evermore I looked at the sea and it seemed to sayI took your baby from you awayI heard a voice cryin' in deepCome join me, baby, in my endless sleep Why did we quarrel, why did we fightWhy did I leave her alone tonightThat's why her footsteps ran into the seaThat's why my baby has gone from me I looked at the sea Ran in the water, heart full of fearThere in the breakers I saw her nearReached for my darling, held her to meStole her away from the angry sea I looked at the sea and it seemed to sayYou took your baby from me awayMy heart cried out, she's mine to keepI saved my baby from that endless sleep Endless sleepEndless sleepEndless sleep
Sitting at the kitchen table Monday afternoonHouse is so quietI spent the morning looking for a jobBut the job markets pretty tight And I'm wonderingJust what I'm gonna doSomeone to hold and the rentI owe are long overdue Seems like everything comes downTo money and love in my lifeIt seems like everything comes downTo money and love in my life I'm used to having a woman aroundCooking for me and when I lay down to loveI got used to having a woman aroundLooking to me to rise above I've got a lonely heart, two open armsAnd a pillow I never useI know it ain't much to offerBut it's the best I can do Seems like everything comes downTo money and love in my life I've loved a lot of good womenAnd I could sure love one nowI've had more than enough moneyIn my bank account But where they went and how they got spentIsn't really clearThey just left me hereAnd it all disappeared Sitting in another office Tuesday morningApplication filledI doubt they'll ever call meBut I can't keep from hoping that they will I know I need to keep my chin upBut I'm telling you the truthIf there's no one else to live forIs there anything left to lose? It seems like everything comes downTo money and love in my lifeSeems like everything comes downTo money and love in my life, in my life
I heard cowboys should never cry,But there are some things that bring tears to my eyes.Some old movies they've shown,Some old people all alone,And everytime I hear that song.Everytime I hear that song,I think of someone who is gone,And the hurtin' starts comin' on real strong,Everytime I hear that song.What makes big old boys like me,Get down on bended knee?And today's girl who's moving ahead,Stay at home all night crying in bed.It's those old loves that linger on,Just like some of those good old songs.Everytime I hear that song,I think of someone who is gone,And the hurtin' starts comin' on real strong,Everytime I hear that song.
They sent me to this prisonFor a crime I did outsideI killed a man and didn't hangBut I might as well have died For every minute that I liveI know that death may callYou see his brother's here with meRight inside these walls And I don't even know his faceBut I'm sure that he knows mine The eyes of death are watchin' meJust bidin' his time(Oh Lord, he takes his time) Each night they slam my lonely cellAnd turn the lights down lowAnd I can't close my eyes to sleepBecause somewhere I know He's planning how he'll drive the knifeInto my poundin' heartAnd Lord this just not knowingWhen will tear a man apart He's just a number not a nameAnd you'll get me from behind The eyes of death are watchin' meJust bidin' his time(Oh Lord, he takes his time) Sometimes I think I'll try to walkAnd face the deadly gunsI'd either die or I'd be freeTo leave this place and run This man he swore to make me payBut he'd rather see me crySo he'll just play around with meWhile I wait to die No prison ever held the manWith a sentence just like mine The eyes of death are watchin' meJust bidin' his time(Oh Lord, he takes his time) He's bidin' his time(Oh Lord, he takes his time)He's just bidin' his time
When it comes to real rounders, there's only oneThat was better than I was at havin' some funNow it's true he shows grey in his beardDoes that mean he's history, or is he a pillar and a peerThis music called country, somethin' we all makeNo, it didn't just happen cause of the latest rageSoon he was the biggest thing to come along in Nashville in those daysHe sang his song called "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way"I don't know if he did or not but I sure know what I sawThe 1st triple platinum in that town was hanging on his wallRadio will play him until the end of timeBecause he's a real legend not the phony kind And I looked in the eyes of WaylonAnd there I saw things that I'd never seen beforeI saw a father and a brother and a friendI saw the nights we spent while out on the roadIt's not the money, it's not the fame, it's not the ladiesAnd the eyes of Waylon just told me soYes, I looked in the eyes of WaylonThere I learned things that I better knowAnd if I doubted there is a hillbilly heavenThe eyes of Waylon just told me so And if I doubted there is a hillbilly heavenThe eyes of old Waylon just told me so
Country music singers, have always been a real close family,But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me.I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction.Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition.They get on me and want to know Hank why do you drink? Hank, why do you roll smoke?Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?Over and over everybody makes my predictions.So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition.I am very proud of my daddy's nameAll though his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same.Stop and think it over. Put yourself in my position.If I get stoned and sing all night long it's a family tradition.So don't ask me, Hank why do you drink? Hank, why do you roll smoke?Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?If I'm down in a honky-tonk some ole slick's trying to give me friction.I said leave me alone I'm singing all night long it's a family tradition.Lord I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim BeamAnd they both tried to kill me in 1973.When that doctor asked me, "son how did you get in this condition?"I said, "hey sawbones, I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition."So don't ask me, Hank why do you drink? Hank, why do roll smoke?Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?Stop and think it over, try and put yourself in my unique position.If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition!
Why do the best lookin' girls have real ugly friends?It seems like it always works like thatYou'll meet a queen; the girl of your dreamsAnd she'll have a friend that's really fatBut you decide to take a chance; this could be a great romanceIf only she could just get rid of her"She's my cousin from the East and I know that she's a beast"And I don't think that this is gonna work So you take them both out while you try to figure out"How can I dump the pig?"You've spent sixty bucks, but things are looking upShe just said she wants to make it bigNow the problem is this, every time we hug and kissHer friend says, "I want to go home!"And we want her to, but we don't know what to doAnd that's why it's time for this song Why do the best lookin' girls have real ugly friends?It seems like it always works like thatOh, you'll meet a queen; the girl of your dreams, And she'll have a friend that's really, really fat! Every time you make your play, you'll find out there ain't no wayTo make love to beauty and the beastWhy do the best lookin' girls have these real ugly friends?Does this only happen to me? Now I'm so hot I could smother, 'cause they both come home to MotherDoes this only happen to me?

Moved on downTo sweet home Alabama in 1974Had to get out of Music CityAnd I had to get off the road Woman, she left and the peopleWouldn't let me sing nothin' but them oldSad songs, had to get high so I wouldn't cryYou know they hit pretty close to home I'm feelin' betterNow that I'm back on the roadGetting it togetherBetween Macon and Muscle Shoals I started turnin' up loud and looking at the crowdAnd bendin' them guitar stringsKnew all the while, though it was my styleCould they ever forget my name Rocked 'ed in Raleigh, knocked 'em outta NashvilleJust couldn't do no wrongPeople went wild and the band said"Child, better keep on playin' your songs" I'm feelin' betterNow that I'm back on the roadGetting it togetherBetween Macon and Muscle Shoals Well, my life ain't the same and I had to changeAnd I hope this music will showA little bit less of cryin' in the beerAnd a little of my own soul Waylon and Toy and all them boysI wanna say thanks to youYour fiddle and your steel make me play what I feelAnd I don't feel lovesick blues I'm feelin' betterNow that I'm back on the roadGetting it togetherBetween Macon and Muscle Shoals All came together in my sweet Alabama homeAnd I'm through forever of tryin' to put everybody onAnd I'm feelin' betterI got hurt but I'm back on the road Getting it together, had to eat a little cornbreadI've been eatin' that cornbread, sleepin' on a featherbedDrinkin' that homegrownWritin' some new songs, do it on, get home Eat a little cornbread, lovin' on a featherbedSmokin' that homegrown, write a few new songsThis here music's homegrown
You're one in a million, a hundred to one shotI took a gamble and just lookie here what I gotA diamond in the middle of a field full of stoneAnd I'm bettin' everything I gotHey, that you can keep me comin' home Finders are keepersAnd I'm keeping you as long as I canFinders are keepersSo baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand A needle in a haystack would be easy to doCompared to me finding somebody else like youI tell you chasing the perfect woman is just like rolling the diceShe's as pretty as a natural elevenAnd I'm puttin' my heart on the line Finders are keepersAnd I'm keeping you as long as I canFinders are keepersSo baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand Finders are keepersSo baby, keep on keepin' on with your lovin' man

It was hard for him to get out of bedWhen the phone rang, sleep-eyed she saidCharlie's drunk againWhy don't you just let it ringThrough the years he'd always picked it upFor the guy who came back and saved his buttWhat they have in common is a brotherhoodSo few could understand[Chorus]They were forged by fireHard times you get beyondGives you an unbreakable bondForged by fireWhen you pray to god, bet the oddsAnd walk through hell togetherYou're foreverForged by fireThe young GI said from his VA bedWhy you wanna hang out with us broken menWhen you could be spending your time with your family and friendsHe told him son, you're family tooI see myself when I look at youIn a place and time you don't forgetAnd even tho we've just met[Chorus]He said goodbye GI see you next weekThen he rolled himself out to the streetIt was pretty hard for him to get his vanAnd throw the wheelchair in the backHe was headed home ready to unwindCharlie called can you help me one more timeHe said Chuck, I'll be there on the doubleFor a brother, it's no trouble[Chorus]
I was born in the Southland! Twenty some odd years ago. Now I ran away for the first time when I was about four years old. I'm a free born man.My home is on my back. Lord, I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile from a railroad track. I got a gal in Cincinatti, got a woman in San Antone. But I always love that girl next door and any ole place is home. I'm a free born man.My home is on my back. Lord, I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile from a railroad track. I've got me a worn out guitar.I carry an ole tote sack. I've hocked it about two-hundred times but I always get it back. I'm a free born man.My home is on my back. Now I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile from a railroad track. You May not like my appearance.You may not like my song, You might not like the way I am but you sure like the way I'm gone I'm a free born man.My home is on my back. Lord, I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile from a railroad track.

Keep a rifle near handBack shooters and grizzlies, better stay alert all the time'Cause the only law here in this wild country is the gun and the knife In the year of our Lord, eighteen sixty-nineI lost my dear son to a cave-in at the mineYes I know he's gone please God rest his soulSo many have died trying to find this damned Gibbonsville gold (Chorus)Yeah, you find just a little, just enough to get byAww, you dig and you dig, and you start wonderin' whyThen someone finds a nugget, just as big as your thumbAnd we all go hard at it from sun until sunYeah I got to find it, that main mother loadI've made up my mind and I swear to find that Gibbonsville gold There's a whole lot more down there, my share of that main mother loadI've made up my mind and I swear to find the Gibbonsville gold --- fade

I've just been to heaven with someone so trueI dreamed about mama last nightShe read me the Bible like she used to doI dreamed about mama last nightShe never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bedAnd on party nights till we came home she often sat and readWe little thought about it then for we were young and gayJust how much mama worried when we children were awayWe only knew she never slept when we were out at nightThat she waited just to know that we'd all come home alrightWhy sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or threeIt seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the keyFor always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd replyBut we were all too young back then to understand the reason whyUntil the last one had returned she'd always keep a lightFor mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnightShe had to know that we were safe before she went to restWell she seemed to fear that the world might harmThe ones that she loved the bestAnd once she told me when you're grown to women and to menPerhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different thenAnd so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's careThat always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' thereThen came the night that we were called together round her bedThe children are all with you now the kindly doctor saidAnd in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender lightThat told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alrightShe smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keepHer children safe from harm throughout the yearsAnd then she went to sleepMy dream is a treasure that I'll always keepI dreamed about mama last night

I wandered so aimless life filed with sinI wouldn't let my dear savior inThen Jesus came like a stranger in the nightPraise the lord I saw the light.[Chorus]I saw the light I saw the lightno more darkness no more nightNow I'm so happy no sorrow in sightPraise the lord I saw the light.Just like a blind man I wandered alongWorries and fears I claimed for my ownThen like the blind man that God gave back his sightPraise the lord I saw the light.[Chorus]I was a fool to wander and astrayStraight is the gate and narrow the wayNow I have traded the wrong for the rightPraise the lord I saw the light.[Chorus]

(There'll be peace in the valley for him how we prayI was with Red Foley the night he passed away)We was down in Port Wayne Indiana the night the Lord took Red awayAnd we had to get there a little early cause we had a matineeAnd when Red first went on stage it seemed that he moved and talked a little slowBut of course he went on to do his regular great showSo soon the afternoon show was over with and we all went down the street and ateRed said he wasn't very hungry but he came along anywayAnd we got done eaten and came back to the last showBut the thing just would be Red's very last well who's to knowAnd when he went on the stage for his own ten thousandth timeWe was all back to the curtains there just shootin' the linesBut when he sang Peace In The Valley there was such a quiet stillI know I'll never forget it and anyone that was there never willWell soon the last show was over withAnd I went back to the hotel and Red gave me a callI told him to come on over I was just starin' at the four wallsSo he came over to my room he was just next door thereLit a cigarette and sat down in the chairAnd he started talkin' bout all the worries that a country music singer hasI said old Red I reckon it's not that badHe said yeah you're workin' a lot now and you'll have 'em some dayYour dad had 'em and I have 'em I guess it's just meant that wayThen he got up and these were the last words he saidI'm awful tired now Hank and I've got to go to bedAnd while I layed there with Red just a few steps awayThe angels came and took him into the last golden stage(There'll be peace in the valley for him how we prayI was with Red Foley the night he passed away)

I feel like a stranger in this home I built for you.And I can't understand this awful change you're goin' through.And lately I've been watchin' you grow colder everyday.And I'd rather be gone than in your way.I'd rather be gone than in your way.I'd rather see someone else here in my place.And if I decide on leavin' my world will end today.But I'd rather be gone than in your way.I'd rather be gone than in your way.I'd rather see someone else here in my place.And if I decide on leavin' my world will end today.But I'd rather be gone than in your way.I'd rather be gone than in your way.
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I don't want to goIf heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I'd just as soon stay homeI was one of the chosen few, to be born in Alabam',I'm just alike my daddy's son, I'm proud of who I am.I went through a lot of good women, and shook old Jim Beam's hand,If I never see the pearly gates, I've walked through the promised land.If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I don't want to go,If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I'd just as soon stay home.If they don't have a Grand Ole Opry, like they do in Tennessee, Just send me to hell or New York City, it would be about the same to me.I've got wild honey trees and crazy little weeds, growin' around my shack,These dusty roads ain't streets of gold, but I'm a happy right where I'm at.All these pretty little southern belles are a country boy's dream,They ain't got wings or halos, but they're sure looking good to me.If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I don't want to goIf heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I'd just as soon stay homeIf heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I don't want to goIf heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I'd just as soon stay homeIf they don't have a Grand Ole Opry, like they do in Tennessee, just send me to hell or New York City, it would be about the same to me.

I'm sittin' in Knoxville CourthouseAin't got a thing to doI don't wanna go to the moviesCouldn't if I wanted to, I'm on trial for lovin' you Now this all started in a honky tonkJust the other side of townA girl come in took a stool by meOrdered gin and drank it down She lit up a cigarette and turned aroundWell, she said my name is JeannieAnd asked me what was mineI answered Hank and I walkedTo the jukebox droppin' a dime I looked at her short dress low neck lineWell, we danced for five or ten minutesAnd I held her close to me Kissed her lips and squeezed her hipsAnd judged about twenty-threeWhispered in my ears, I said, "Yes siree" Now the scene is a little motelOut on the state highwayAnd there's a room for twoLove is about to take place And a state trooper breaks down the doorShines a flash light in my faceI said, "What the hell is this"And another man and woman come in And the girl I'm with starts cryin' and screamin'And she runs over to themSaid, "Thank God you're hereHe tried to hurt me mama" I said now you don't meanThe cop says, "Son the girl is seventeen"So that's why I'm in Knoxville courthouseAnd the judge passed sentence on me And it's ten long years for statutory rapeIn the state penitentiaryLord, I can't believe this is happened to me So when next time you give a girl the eyeShe gives you that certain smileJust remember under that woman's breastMay beat the heart of a child Don't you let yourself be the oneTo help a mixed up kids go wildThis story happened a lot that's trueBut you better hope and pray it never happens to you
Well you know you get the hots for some gal, you just can't stopMakin' love six times a day better than pork chop'Cause ones' good as the other and you know what I meanSome of them like a little bit of fatSome of them like that meat just a little bit lean I like gravy on the side with hot and juicy lovin'Brown sugar on top, sausage warm out of the ovenSometimes you get to eatin' Lord and you just can't stopMake me wonder to myselfWhy oh why, why did I leave that last pork chop Well met this fine gal in the choir, she sure could singShe said come down to my houseI'm gonna give you ham hocks and beansWe devoured each other Lord, her kitchen was smokin' hotI had to jump up and open a window and I thought to myselfWhy did I leave that last pork chop I have been on a very strict diet of beer and scotch and loveI was offered lunch break specials, but now I'm a fool for herShe'd been serving that pie while I was gone punchin' the clockI thought about that waitress down at Maxine's and I said to myselfWhy did I leave that last pork chop
I went home with the waitressThe way I always doHow was I to knowShe was with theRussians too? I was gambling in HavanaI took a little riskSend lawyers, guns and moneyThey'll get me out of this, hah!  I'm the innocent bystanderSomehow I got stuckBetween the rockAnd a hard placeAnd I'm down on my luckYes I'm down on my luckWell I'm down on my luck I'm hiding in HondurasI'm a desperate manSend lawyers, guns and moneyThe shit has hit the fan (Instrumental) All rightSend lawyers, guns and moneyHuh! Uhh! Send lawyers, guns and moneyUhh! Send lawyers, guns and moneyHyah! Send lawyers, guns and moneyOoh! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Uh!

Well I kicked the habit, of smoking back sometime ago.And I tried the hard stuff,but I had to let all that go.But the toughest thing I ever gave up was today.Cause Old Habits Like You are hard to break. I chew lifesavers to help me get off ciggarates.But you know for your love I aint found no lifesavers yet.And I've grown cold Turkey cause theres not even on kiss ad day.And Old habits like you are hard to break. Old habits like you are hard to break.Love with someone new is so hard to make.I had grown so use to your love and all of your ways. And Old Habits Like You are hard to breakBla
The old Nashville cowboy was burdened with timeHe was bent by his years and the fight with the wineWith a head full of music and an old nursery rhymeA heart full of sadness and dark sunken nightsHe told me they cheated he told me they stoleThe strength from his youth and the songs from his soulHe said he was family till he got too oldAnd he called them miners mother load findersDigging so deep in search of more goldOh where are the cowboys and the home on the rangeDoes anyone know that they've killed Jesse JamesNow the good guys on TV seem bad ain't it strangeAnd the old Nashville cowboys missed out on the changeThe old cowboy's life now is gone with the pastLike whiskey he drank it all went out too fastHe didn't know how to make each swallow lastAnd the head waitress won't be back to fill up his glassOh where are the cowboys and the home on the rangeDoes anyone know that they've killed Jesse JamesIs anyone listening or is everyone blindAnd old Nashville cowboys will sing for a dimeAnd hard times are cheap at the end of the line
Like crippled ships that made it through the storms and finally reached a quiet shoreThe homeless found a home on Susan's floorI didn't feel so cold and tired stretched out before her fireRolling smokes and drinking up her wineAnd I remember candle light and singing till we could not sing no moreAnd falling warm asleep on Susan's floorWell now that my song is sweeter I think I'd like to greet herAnd thank her for the favors that she gaveA stranger I came my head bowed in the rain to her doorI sat and sang my songs on Susan's floorIn the morning I'd go on buying kingdoms with my songsKnowing I'd be back in just a while warming in the sunlight of her smile[Steel]Well lots of time and songs have passed I catch myself looking backReliving all the wonder of those nightsThat's where I'd be today if I had only stay one night moreAnd sang another song on Susan's floorLike crippled ships that made it through the storms and finally reached a quiet shoreThe homeless found a home on Susan's floor

I wish you'd look who's crawling back to you I never thought I'd live to see todayI swore to you the day I left this time I'd go for goodAnd I was even proud enough to tell myself I couldBut it took a lot of lonely nights to ever change my mindIt took a lot of missing youth and things that I'd left behindIntending to keep going but the going it got too roughAnd pride's not hard to swallow once you chewed it long enoughI know we won't always see eye to eyeBut if you'll take me back this time I'll really trySo many things I could have done so much I failed to doI've never needed anyone as much as I need youAnd it took a lot of lonely nights...
I don't care if you never come home.I don't mind if you justKeep on rolling away on a distant sea,'Cause I don't love you and you don't love me.You cause a commotion when you come to town.You give 'em a smile and they melt.And your lovers and friends is all good and fine.But I don't like yours and you don't like mine.La la la la la la laI don't care what you do late at night.No, and I don't care how you get your delights.I'll leave you alone,I'll just let you be.I don't love you and you don't love me.I got a problem, can you relate?I got a woman callin' love hate.We made a vow that we'd always be friends.How could we know that promises end?La la la la la la laI tried to love you for years upon years.You wouldn't take it for real.It's time you saw what I wanted you to see,And I'd still love you and you'd still love me.I got a problem, can you relate?I got a woman callin' love hate.Aw, we made a vow that we'd always be friends.How could we know that promises end?La la la la la la laLa la la la la la la

Sometimes I wake upAnd drag my sorry ass out of bedSometimes I don'tAnd I just lay there insteadI'm going down to the store todayAnd hope my cold sores all go awaySometimes I just put on my socks [Chorus:]Well, I'm Ramblin' in my shoesI'm ramblin' in my shoesI'm a-ramblin' in my shoes'Cause I got a hole in my socks Sometimes I wet the bedAnd lie in my own filthSometimes I don'tI get up and go to the bathroomI'm going down to the store todayAnd hope my cold sores all go awaySometimes I just go barefooted [Chorus 4x]
I can settle dow-own and be doin'just fineTil I hear an old train rollin'down the lineThen I hurry strai-aight home and packAnd if I didn' go, I believe I' blow my stackI love you ba-aby, but you gotta understandWhen the lord made meHe made a ramblin' man. Some folks might sa-ay that I' no goodThat I wouldn' settle down if I couldBut when that open ro-oad starts to callin'meThere' somethin'o'r the hill that I gotta seeSometimes it' har-rd but you gotta understandWhen the lord made me, he made a ra-amblin'man. I love to see the tow-owns a-passin'byAnd to ride these rails 'eath god' blue skyLet me travel this la-and from the mountains to the sea'Cause that' the life I believe he meant for meAnd when I' go-one and at my grave you standJust say God called home your ra-amblin'man.
There's coming a day when the world shall melt awayAnd Jesus shall come to claim his ownNo more tears no painNo woe in this wicked world belowThen will you be ready to go homeWill you be ready to go ready to go homeTo live with him up there round the throneWhen he says come unto me will your soul be claim and freeThen will you be ready to go home In this world of greed and hate will you wait till it's too lateToo late to claim the Saviour for your ownFor he's coming someday to bear your soul awayThen will you be ready to go homeWill you be ready to go...Then will you be ready to go home

Did you say she asked about me today? I guess that she heard of the records I've made. Tell her I've found money but I ain't found the time, but she's still the star on the stage of my mind. Since you mentioned her who I already miss, the look of her smile and the touch of her kiss, and I thought I was through with feeling like this, but in this point in time, she's the star on the stage of my mind. The runway lights whisper as the plane passes by. Where's the dark-haired young lover that was with you last time? The stewardess smiles and the first class seat cries, cause to all others I'm blind for she's still the star on the stage of my mind. Tell her I've found money but I ain't found the time

[Chorus]Storms never last, do they baby.  Bad times all pass with the windYour hand in mine stills the thunder, and your love makes the sun Want to shine.I've followed you down so many roads, Baby I've picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs.  And every road you took I know your search was for the truth. And the cloud that's brewing now won't be your last.[Chorus]

Back about eighteen and twenty-five I left Tennessee very much alive I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud If I hadn't been riding on the Tennessee StudHad some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa One of her brothers was a bad outlaw I wrote a letter to my Uncle Spud And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud On a Tennessee Stud The Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and his eyes were green He had the nerve and he had the blood There never was a horse like Tennessee StudDrifted on down into no man's land Across the river called the Rio Grande Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe Til I got me a skin full of silver and goldMe and the gambler, we couldn't agree We got in a fight over Tennessee Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud And I rode away on a Tennessee StudThe Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and his eyes were green He had the nerve and he had the blood There was never a horse like the Tennessee StudI rode right back across Arkansas I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa I found that girl with the golden hair She was riding on a Tennessee MarePretty little baby on the cabin floor Little horse colt playing round the door I loved the girl with the golden hair And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee MareThe Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and his eyes were green He had the nerve and he had the blood There was never a horse like the Tennessee Stud

If you fly in from Birmingham you'll get the lastIf you blew in from Boston no you sure won't have to waitAnd I'm learning, a little more every dayAbout the power of the dollar,And the people with white collarsAnd the good old American way I've noticed I don't get much helpWhen they see my blue jeansSome slick with a suit walks up,Oh can I help you pleaseYes I'm learning, as I gain a little ageAbout the power of the dollar,And the people with white collarsAnd the good old American way. Some high society lady saysIs your horse outsideNo ma'am he's between my legsBut your too fat to rideAnd your learning,A little more about my waysAnd what I think about your dollarAnd your white collarAnd your good old American way If you don't like my Nudie bootsI'm sorry about thatDon't make fun of my hat tooOr you might get knocked flatAnd you'll learn some more,If you ever pass down our wayAbout the folks without the dollars,And without white collarsHell, they are the American way!

Well I've been hangin' out with my Rebel son Kid RockAnd I don't really like this stuff they call Hip HopBut he's sure been good to meAnd I'm still tryin' to make him seeIn country music, you just can't say the F word My son Shelton say he's been havin' a hard timeYea he does great shows but he's just gotta speak his own mindWell I wonder where that came from?I guess he's a real son-of-gun.Take the old man's advice, be nice, and lose the F word No, no in country music you just can't say the F wordOh we've come a long way but it's best if that one's not heardOh we've had some hells and damnsBut we don't say "bitch" we say, "why yes ma'am."Cause in country music you just don't use the F word Today's hot new country, it sounds pretty good to meBut it's time for basics, our roots and some realityYou gotta scrape me off the ceilingMrs. Hawkins says it with feelingBut in country music you just can't say the F word No, no in country music you just can't say the F wordOh we've come a long way but it's best if that one's not heardOh we've had some hells and damnsBut we don't say "bitch" we say, "why yes ma'am."Cause in country music you just don't use the F word Some of these guys say it 500 timesBut in country music you don't use it one damn lineOh in country music we don't say the F word
Kind of Woman I Got(version from Osborne Brothers "Country Bluegrass" tape)You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.Well, the very first thing in the morning is "Get Up."The last thing I hear every night is "Shut Up."I found out my own cooking don't tast too hot.You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.Well, when I'm around the house, you're always a fussing.Nothing pleases you and you start cussing.I put up with you, and that's a heck of a lot.You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.If I had any sense at all I'd go crazy,But that would do you too much good so I'm not.Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy.You aint' the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.(Banjo plays a verse)If I had any sense at all I'd go crazy,But that would do you too much good so I'm not.Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy.You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.
I know it's over cause I don't keep you satisfied anymoreBut before you move along let me sing you the last love songTomorrow when I'll wake what will take the placeOf smiles on your face and black hair against white laceAnd I wonder if I'll be thinking of our early morning loveAll the sweet things that you'd say that's brighten up my darkest dayAnd tomorrow night what do use the chest to take the place of your breastBreast against my chest oh how I'll miss your tenderness but there's no use to cryin'Cause love's a grown up game a little pleasure then a lot of painFirst we call each other bad names then what we have was never quite the sameI wish I could find eyes that won't cry lips that won't lie and love that won't dieHmm hmm hmm hm and a love that won't die
The streets are paved with tourist and the record companies flourish,Lord knows every singer wants to be the king.But some of them couldn't take it and some good one's didn't make it.That's the way it goes on The Nashville Scene.Now there's a wino on the corner,He was a well known guitar picker 'til he got burned out by the game.Now he'll bum you for some whiskey And tell you how it was back in '52 when he played for Hank.And I'm watching the sun go down this evening And soon it will wake this town that's made of dreams.But before it does a new star will be shining And that's the way it is on the Nashville scene.From the outside its a castle, From the inside its a prison its easy to live way beyond your means.And its a long, long way to the top And even further when you drop and I've been on both ends of the Nashville scene.
Well I work like a dog eight hours a day you know I'm nearly deadWhen I stop by a bar on my way home and loosen up my headLord knows this is a hard life sometimes it'll drive a man crazyAnd there ain't no pleasure in this life for me but the nighttime and my babyWell I'd love to ride all over town in a brand new CadillacBut on the money that I'm makin' it'll never be like thatBut money don't buy everythingLike tender love that I always got at home just a waitin'And the only pleasure in this life for me is the nighttime and my babyWhen I get home she's always got good lovin' saved up for meHer warm sweet lips will make me forget all of my miseryWith her arms wrapped around me all through the long long nightI wake up in the morning feeling right mighty rightStart back to that old job again with the boss standin' over meSayin' hurry up you gotta do your work that's the way it's gonna beTen hours just keep on draggin' Lord don't you know that this life of mine ain't easyBut I wanna thank you for sendin' me the nighttime and my babyYeah I wanna thank you very much for sendin' me the nighttime and my babyOh I don't know bout makin' a nap if it wadn't for the nighttime and my babyI believe I'd lose my mind if I didn't have the nighttime and my baby
I got someone at home don't know what's going onThinks I love her and her alone and the pressure is onI've got a new love you see she does new minds to meWe sneak our love you's on the phone and the pressure is onAnd it puts pressure on a man if he ever lets his heart call his handHe ain't no rolling stone but the pressure is on[ fiddle - organ ]Feel like your ten thousand feet down under the seaAnd it's crushing all your bones and the pressure is onThe trains I ride in my dreams run on the pressure of the steamLord I could pull one a mile long cause the pressure is onLord I could pull one a mile long cause the pressure is onThe pressure is on the pressure at home
Well I was thumbin' from MontgomeryHad my guitar on my back.When a stranger stopped besideMe in an antique cadillac.He was dressed like nineteen fifty,Half drunk and hollow eyed.He said it's a long walk to Nashville, son would you like a ride?I sat down in the front seat, he turned on the radio.And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers,was solid country gold.Then i noticed the stranger was ghost white pale,When he asked me for a light.And i knew there was something strange about this ride.Chorus:He said "Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing,Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues, Can you bend them guitar strings?He said "Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside,'cause if you'rr big star bound let me warn ya it's a long hard ride."Then he cried just south of Nashville,and he turned that car around.He said "This is where you get off boy, Because i'm going back to Alabam.As i stepped out of that cadillac, I said mister many thanks,He said "you don't have to call me mister, mister,the whole world called me hank.Chorus 2xIf you're big star bound let me warn ya, it's a long hard ride.

I come home late at night with my boots in my hands.Stumble in the back door being quiet as I can.And I know she's there in bed, cold and all alone.And she's crying because I'm breaking up our home.And she knows the hell I'm going through in this world inside my head.There's a devil in the bottle lord and he wants to see me dead.I fall into her arms and she helps me with my clothes.Guess she stays on with me cause she really knows,That I'm tryin' Lord, to find my freedom by excaping to the only freedom I've ever known.And she knows the hell I'm going through in this world inside my head.There's a devil in the bottle lord and he won't rest until I'm dead.There's a devil living in the bottle Lord and he won't rest 'til I'm deadAnd its killing her too, watching me die this way

Your cheatin' heart will make you weepYou'll cry and cry and try to sleepBut sleep won't come the whole night throughYour cheatin' heart will tell on youWhen tears come down like falling rainYou'll toss around and call my nameYou'll walk the floor the wayI do your cheatin' heart will tell on youWhen tears come downYour cheatin' heart will tell on you
You wore out a brand new trunkPackin' and un-packin' your junkYour daddy's mad
The hour's late and so I try to walk in silenceToward the house we've shared so many yearsSuddenly I find my feet will go no fartherAnd I stand here in the darkness fighting tears How could I forget that I no longer live hereWhen this is where my life's whole meaning isOh how could I forget the hurt the night you told meEverything, once yours and mine, is yours and his What made me slip into the shadows toward a windowWhen I knew I had no business thereI lost control and I couldn't keep from shoutingHey that's our room, someone get him out of there My shout was heard I hear my daughter cryingWish that I could give her just one little kissBut I must run before they find me out here pryingEverything, once yours and mine, is yours and his Oh I must run before they find me out here pryingEverything, once yours and mine, is yours and his
