When I was youngI never needed anyoneAnd makin' love was just for funThose days are gone Livin' aloneI think of all the friends I've knownBut when I dial the telephoneNobody's home All by myselfDon't wanna be, all by myself anymoreAll by myselfDon't wanna live, all by myself anymore Hard to be sureSome times I feel so insecureAnd love so distant and obscureRemains the cure All by myselfDon't wanna be, all by myself anymoreAll by myselfDon't wanna live, all by myself anymore When I was youngI never needed anyoneAnd makin' love was just for funThose days are gone All by myselfDon't wanna be, all by myself anymoreAll by myselfDon't wanna live, all by myself anymore All by myselfDon't wanna be, all by myself anymoreAll by myselfDon't wanna live, all by myself anymore All by myself

They were doolin', doolin'-daltonHigh or low, it was the sameEasy money, and faithless womenRed eye whiskey for the pain.Go down little dalton, it must be God's willTwo brothers lyin' dead in Coffeeville.Two voices call to you from where they stood,"Lay down your law books now, they're no damn good."Better keep on movin', doolin'-daltonTill your shadow sets you free.And if you're fast, and if you're lucky,You will never see that hangin' tree.Well the towns lay out across the dusty plainLike graveyards filled with tombstones waitin' for the namesAnd a man could use his back or use his brainsBut some just went stir-crazy Lord cause nothin' ever changedTill they're doolin' Neville DaltonHe was workin' cheap, just buyin' timeAnd then he laughed and said I'm goin'And so he left that peaceful life behind

Early in the morningAbout the break of dayThe earlybird is workingSo his life don't fade awaySpends his life denying thatHe's got no time for flyingIn the breezeHigh up on his own, the eagle flies aloneAnd he is freeEarlybird is scratching thoughThe going's getting toughTime is passing by him and he justCan't get enoughHe'll tell you all is well whenAll is really going wrongThe earlybird will wake one dayAnd find his life is goneYou know I like to lay in bedAnd sleep out in the sunReading books and playing crazy musicJust for funYou know it makes feel so fineAnd puts my mind at ease toKnow that I don't harm a soulIn doing what I pleaseAny old day you say,Ain't gonna fade awayAny old day you say,Ain't gonna fade away

It's not the first timeThat I've had the sense that something's wrongBut I'm old enough to knowThat things don't always work out like they shouldI know you're tryin' hardTo break it gently to me, nowBut there's no easy wayTo tell it like it is, so baby...I don't want to hear any moreYou don't need to tell me it's overI've been here beforeI've seen that look beforeI know it well; it comes as no surpriseYou've been avoiding meBut now you want to talk it overBefore you take my handAnd tell me softly in a whisperThere's no need to explainI've read the book; I know how this all endsI don't want to hear any moreYou don't need to tell me it's overI've been here beforeI won't ask you to stayI won't stand in your wayLook me right in the eyesLet me walk away with my head highIf there's some other guyI don't need to know whyBut I don't want to hear any moreYou don't need to tell me it's overI've been here beforeI won't ask you to stayI won't stand in your wayAnd I don't want to hear any moreNo, no, babyI don't want to hear any more

I love to watch a woman danceShe bows her head and lifts her handsHer hips begin to circle slowlyHer eyes have closed; her face is holyShe holds the whole world in tranceI love to watch a woman danceYeah, I love to watch a woman danceShe likes the slow songs of love lostThey take her a million miles away'Cause to dream, sometimes, is the only wayTo go places you can't get to any other wayOur eyes connect; she takes my handI love to watch a woman danceYeah, I love to watch a woman danceI feel my heart beating, and I wonderWill it ever satisfy my longing?I'm gonna hold on to you for as long as I canFor who knows, this dance may be our only danceSo we danced together, close and slowSo slow we're almost standing stillHer warm breath against my neckSlowly breaking down my willThe room spins so I can barely standThe song ends; then, she lets go of my handThere?s so much I don?t understandBut I love to watch a woman danceYeah, I love to watch a woman dance
I wish you peace when the cold winds blow Warmed by the fire's glow I wish you comfort in the, the lonely time And arms to hold you when you ache inside I wish you hope when things are going bad Kind words when times are sad I wish you shelter from the, the raging wind Cooling waters at the fever's end I wish you peace when times are hard The light to guide you through the dark And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low I wish you the strength to let love grow onI wish you the strength to let love flowI wish you peace when times are hard A light to guide you through the dark And when storms are high and your, you dreams are low I wish you the strength to let let grown onI wish you the strength to let love flow onI wish you the strength to let love glow on I wish you the strength to let love go
Somewhere out there on that horizon Out beyond the neon lights I know there must be somethin' better But there's nowhere else in sight It's survival in the city When you live from day to day City streets don't have much pity When you're down, that's where you'll stay In the city, oh, oh. In the city I was born here in the city With my back against the wall Nothing grows, and life ain't very pretty No one's there to catch you when you fall Somewhere out on that horizon Faraway from the neon sky I know there must be somethin' better And I can't stay another night In the city, oh, oh. In the cityIn the cityIn the cityIn the city
How come you love him when he Takes you for a fool He`s only lookin` for a good time How can he love you when he Treats you mean and cruel He`s not the best thing that you could find Is it true? I can`t believe it Is it true? I just can`t see it Is it true? Is that you? When we were young, we didn`t really have a care You were hung up, I had a good line I never knew it then but, man, I was in love How could I know it was the right time? Is it true? You`ve lost that feelin`? Is is true? You might be leavin`? Is it true? Don`t want to find out Yes, I was so wrong For leading you on There wasn`t much I could do I was a wild one, but I can change some If that`s important to you Is it true- you`ve lost that feelin`? Is it true- you might be leavin`? Is it true? Is it true? She`s really leavin` She`s really leavin`
A perfect day, the sun is sinkin' lowAs evening falls, the gentle breezes blowThe time we shared went by so fastJust like a dream, we knew it couldn't lastBut I'd do it all againIf I could, somehowBut I must be leavin' soonIt's your world nowIt's your world nowMy race is runI'm moving onLike the setting sunNo sad goodbyesNo tears allowedYou'll be alrightIt's your world nowEven when we are apartYou'll always be in my heartWhen dark clouds appear in the skyRemember true love never diesBut first a kiss, one glass of wineJust one more dance while there's still timeMy one last wish: someday, you'll seeHow hard I tried and how much you meant to meIt's your world nowUse well the timeBe part of something goodLeave something good behindThe curtain fallsI take my bowThat's how it's meant to beIt's your world nowIt's your world nowIt's your world now
James Dean, James Dean, I know just what you mean.James Dean, you said it all so cleanAnd I know my life would look alrightIf I could see it on the silver screen.You were the low down rebel if there ever wasEven if you had no cause.James dean, you said it all so cleanAnd I know my life would look alrightIf I could see it on the silver screen.We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator,You were just too cool for school.Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop,The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules.James Dean, James Dean, so hungry and so lean.James Dean, you said it all so cleanAnd I know my life would look alrightIf I could see it on the silver screen.Little James Dean up on the screenWonderin' who he might be.Along came a spyder, picked up a rider,Took him down the road to eternity.James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen.James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen.You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye bye.You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye bye.Bye bye too fast to live too young to dieBye bye too fast to live too young to dieBye bye too fast to live too young to dieBye bye too fast to live too young to dieToo fast to live too young to dieOo-oo-oo-oo too fast to live too young to dieBye bye too fast to live too young to dieOh, James Dean too fast to live too young to die

It's just another day in paradise As you stumble to your bed You'd give anything to silence Those voices ringing in your head You thought you could find happiness Just over that green hill You thought you would be satisfied But you never will- Learn to be still We are like sheep without a shepherd We don't know how to be alone So we wander 'round this desert And wind up following the wrong gods home But the flock cries out for another And they keep answering that bell And one more starry-eyed messiah Meets a violent farewell- Learn to be still Learn to be still Now the flowers in your garden They don't smell so sweet Maybe you've forgotten The heaven lying at your feet There are so many contradictions In all these messages we send (We keep asking) How do I get out of here Where do I fit in? Though the world is torn and shaken Even if your heart is breakin' It's waiting for you to awaken And someday you will- Learn to be still Learn to be still You just keep on runnin' Keep on runnin'

Tell me the truth, how do you feel? Like you're rollin' so fast that you're spinnin' your wheels? Don't feel too bad, you're not all along We're all tryin' to get along With ev'rybody else try'n' to go their way You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say? Just go along 'til they turn out the lights There's nothin' we can do to fight it No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain And we who must remain go on living just the same I once knew a man, very talented guy He's sing for the people and people would cry They knew that his song came from deep down inside You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind Called him home My man's got it made He's gone far beyond the pain And we who must remain go on living just the same We who must remain go on laughing just the same
Tell me the truth, how do you feel? Like you're rollin' so fast that you're spinnin' your wheels?

Just go along 'til they turn out the lights There's nothin' we can do to fight it No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain And we who must remain go on living just the same I once knew a man, very talented guy He's sing for the people and people would cry They knew that his song came from deep down inside You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind Called him home My man's got it made He's gone far beyond the pain And we who must remain go on living just the same We who must remain go on laughing just the same

Harry got up Dressed all in black Went down to the station And he never came back They found his clothing Scattered somewhere down the track And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning He had a home The love of a girl But men get lost sometimes As years unfold One day he crossed some line And he was too much in this world But I guess it doesn't matter anymore In a New York Minute Everything can change In a New York Minute Things can get pretty strange In a New York Minute Everything can change In a New York Minute Lying here in the darkness I hear the sirens wail Somebody going to emergency Somebody's going to jail If you find somebody to love in this world You better hand on tooth and nail The wolf is always at the door In a New York Minute Everything can change In a New York Minute Things can get a little strange In a New York Minute Everything can change In a New York Minute And in these days When darkness falls early And people rush home To the ones they love You better take a fool's advice And tak care of your own One day they're here; Next day they're gone I pulled my coat around my shoulders And took a walk down through the park The leaves were falling around me The groaning city in the gathering dark On some solitary rock A desperate lover left his mark, "Baby, I've changed. Please come back." What the head makes cloudy The heart makes very clear The days were so much brighter In the time when she was here But I know there's somebody somewhere Make these dark clouds disappear Until that day, I have to believe I believe, I believe In a New York Minute Everything can change In a New York Minute You can get out of the rain In a New York Minute Everything can change In a New York Minute

Well my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55As I drove away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the paradeJust a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.And it's six in the morning, gave me no warning; I had to be on my way.Well there's trucks all a-passing me, and the lights are all flashing,I'm on my way home from your place.And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the paradeJust a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.And my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck,Freeway cars and trucks, freeway cars and trucks, freeway cars and trucks

There are stars in the southern skySouthward as you go.There is moonlight and moss in the treesDown the Seven Bridges Road.Now I have loved you like a baby...Like some lonesome child,And I have loved you in a tame way,And I have loved you wild.Sometimes there's a part of meHas to turn from here and go...Running like a child from these warm starsDown the Seven Bridges Road.There are stars in the southern sky.And if ever you decide you should go,There is a taste of time sweet and honeyDown the Seven Bridges Road.

Used to be so easy to give my heart awayBut I found out the hard wayThere's a price you have to payI found out that love was no friend of mineI should have known time after time So long, it was so long agoBut I've still got the blues for you Used to be so easy to fall in love againBut I found out the hard wayIt's a road that leads to painI found that love was more than just a gameYou're playin' to winBut you lose just the same So long, it was so long agoBut I've still got the blues for you So many years since I've seen your faceHere in my heart, there's an empty spaceWhere you used to be So long, it was so long agoBut I've still got the blues for you Though the days come and goThere is one thing I knowI've still got the blues for you

It wasn't really sad the way they said goodbyeOr maybe it just hurt so bad, she couldn't cryHe packed his things, walked out the door and drove awayAnd she became the girl from yesterdayHe took a plane across the sea to some foreign landShe stayed at home and tried so hard to understandHow someone who had been so close could be so far awayAnd she became the girl from yesterdayShe doesn't know what's right, she doesn't know what's wrongShe only knows the pain that comes from waiting so longAnd she doesn't count the teardrops that she's cried while he's awayBecause she knows deep in her heart that he'll be back somedayThe light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phoneTalking to a memory that's never coming homeShe dreams of his returning and the things that he might sayBut she'll always be the girl from yesterdayYeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday

I got the call today, I didn't wanna hearBut I knew that it would comeAn old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phoneShe said you found someoneAnd I thought of all the bad luck,And the struggles we went throughAnd how I lost me and you lost youWhat are these voices outside love's open doorMake us throw off our contentmentAnd beg for something more? I'm learning to live without you nowBut I miss you sometimesThe more I know, the less I understandAll the things I thought I knew, I'm learning againI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the MatterBut my will gets weak And my thoughts seem to scatterBut I think it's about forgivenessForgivenessEven if, even if you don't love me anymore These times are so uncertain There's a yearning undefined...People filled with rageWe all need a little tendernessHow can love survive in such a graceless ageThe trust and self-assurance that can lead to happinessThey're the very things we kill, I guessPride and competition cannot fill these empty armsAnd the work I put between us,Doesn't keep me warm I'm learning to live without you nowBut I miss you, BabyThe more I know, the less I understandAll the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn againI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the MatterBut everything changesAnd my friends seem to scatterBut I think it's about forgivenessForgivenessEven if, even if you don't love me anymore There are people in your life who've come and goneThey let you down and hurt your prideBetter put it all behind you; life goes onYou keep carrin' that anger, it'll eat you inside I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the MatterBut my will gets weak And my thoughts seem to scatterBut I think it's about forgivenessForgivenessEven if, even if you don't love me anymore I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the MatterBecause the flesh will get weak And the ashes will scatterSo I'm thinkin' about forgivenessForgivenessEven if, even if you don't love me anymore

She's one of a kind Sometimes hard to find Like a rainbow Well, she's lost all her glory And could tell you some stories That we all should know And there's too many hands Being laid on her Too many eyes will never see That it's dragging her down But you won't hear a sound as She turns 'round Her beauty all aflight It always seems to turn the tide At midnight And for her there is no rest We are doing what is best For our future One of these days she may not Be so good to you One of these days she might Shake you to the ground But her fire is still burning And her heart is still yearning to be foundToo many hands Being laid on her Too many eyes will never see That it's dragging her down Still you won't hear a sound as She turns 'round Too many hands Too many hands
