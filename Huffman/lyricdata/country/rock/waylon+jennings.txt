Today there's no salvation band's packed up and goneI'm left standing with my penny in my handDown at railroad station a blind man sings his songI think he sees things I don't understandIt's the 33rd of August and I'm finally touching downEight days from Sunday finds me Saturday boundI stumbled through the darkness tumble to my kneesA thousand voices screaming in my brainWound up in a squad car busted down for vacancyOutside my cell it's sure as hell looks just like rainIt's the 33rd of August...I've put my dangerous feelings under lock and chainKilled my violent nature with a smileLet the demons danced and sang their songs within my fevered brainNot all my God like thoughts were defiledIt's the 33rd of August...
I guess it all started when I woke upThis morning everything seemed okayTill I let my pet snake get loose in the kitchenNow I've been in trouble all day.I got some paint on the wall a pretty orange colorAnd a little on the carpet and floorI covered it up with mom's coat from the closetThat she says she can't wear anymore.I've had a bad, bad dayNot like I thought it would beI've had a bad, bad dayIt seems like everyone's picking on me.I put some sand in my grandpa's tobaccoAnd he frowned at me all dayThen I hid his pipe 'cause it smells when he smokes itHe shouldn't smoke anyway.So between mom's coat and my grandpa's tobaccoLife can be rough on a kidThey've almost worn out the seat of my britchesIt don't hurt much now, but it did.I've had a bad, bad dayNot like I thought it would beI've had a bad, bad dayIt seems like everyone's picking on me.I've had a bad, bad dayNot like I thought it would beI've had a bad, bad dayIt seems like everyone's picking on me
(Don Gibson)If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy gameI'd be a legend a living legend in my timeIf they gave gold statues for tears and regretsI'd be a legend a living legend in my time.But they don't give awards and there's no praise or fameFor a heart that's been broken over love that's in vainIf loneliness meant world acclaim everyone would know my nameI'd be a legend a living in my time.--- Instrumental ---But they don't give awards and there's no praise or fameFor a heart that's been broken over love that's in vainIf loneliness meant world acclaim everyone would know my nameI'd be a legend a living in my time...
I don't look the way the average cowboy singer looksI'll admit I've taken things I never should of tookYou can read a different story in a lot of different booksBut even then you won't really knowHow it was a long time agoWomen have been my trouble since I found out they weren't menIn spite of that I stopped and took a wife now and thenThey built their fences high but they couldn't hold me inI was born with a fire down belowAnd I learned to fly a long time agoDon't ask me about the years I spent out in the rainAbout the ones I spent in love or the ones I spent insaneDon't ask me who I gave my seat to on that planeI think you already knowI told you that a long time agoMe and ol' Willie, lordy we've been sold and boughtI guess you all heard about some kind of system that we foughtWe ain't the only outlaws just the only ones they caughtThey tried to run us off but Willie's slowI quit running a long time ago
As I watched the tail lights disappearSuddenly it got real lonely hereI know the words I could have saidTo make her turn aroundBut a lot of good it's gonna do me nowI could have started with I'm sorryAnd really meant it from the heartThe rest would have been easyTogether in the darkWe could have found that old time feelingThat we lost somewhere somehowBut a lot of good it's gonna do me nowStill thinking about the things I could have saidAnd looking at her picture by the bedI realized just what I've lost as I pulled the covers downBut a lot of good it's gonna do me nowI could have told her I was sorryAnd really meant it from the heartThe rest would have been easyTogether in the darkWe could have found that old time feelingThat we lost somewhere somehowBut a lot of good it's gonna do me nowA lot of good it's gonna do me now

I've held it all inward, God knows, I've tried,But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life,To look in the mirror in total surprise.At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes.

Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.It's a measure of people who don't understand,The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band.I got my first guitar when I was fourteen, Well I finally made forty, still wearing jeans.Amanda, light of my life.Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.Amanda, light of my life. Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.

Winding your way down on Baker StreetLite in your head and dead on your feetWell, another crazy day you drink the night awayAnd forget about everything.These city streets make you feel so coldIt's got so many people but it's got no soulAnd it's taken you so long to find out you were wrongWhen you thought it held everything.Used to think that it was so easyUsed to say that it was so easyYou're tryin', you're tryin' nowAnother year and then you'd be happyOne more year and then you'd be happyYou're cryin', you're cryin' now.Way down the street there's a light in his placeYou open the door he's got that look on his faceAnd he asks you where you've beenYou tell him who you've seenAnd you talk about anything.He's got this dream about buyin' some landHe's gonna give up the booze and the one night standsThen he'll settle down, it's a quiet little townAnd forget about everything.But you know he'll always keep movingKnow he's never gonna stop moving'Cause he's rollin', he's the rolling stoneAnd when you wake up it's a new morningThe sun is shining it's a new morningYou're goin' you're goin' home

Way down in Virginia Amongst the tall grown sugar canes Lived a simple man and a Dominique hen And a rose of a different name. Well, the first time I fell lightly I was standing in the drizzling rain With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin And a rose of a different name. Well, the devil made me do it the first time The second time I done it on my own Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man And help me leave that black rose alone. When the devil made that woman Lord, she threw the pattern away She was built for speed with the tools You need to make a new fool every day. Way down deep and dirty On the darker side of shame I caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin With a rose of a different name. The devil made me do it the first time The second time I done it on my own Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man And help me leave that black rose alone. The devil made me do it the first time The second time I done it on my own Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man And help me leave that black rose alone...
(Red Lane)I was sittin' beside the road in Blackjack CountyNot knowing that the sheriff paid a bountyFor men like me who didn't have a penny to their namesSo he locked my leg to thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chain.All we had to eat was bread and waterEach day we had to build that road a mile and a quarterBlack sneak whip would cut our backs when some poor fool complainedBut we couldn't fight back wearin' 35 pounds of Blackjack County chain.And then one night while the sheriff was a sleepin'We all gathered round him slowly creepin'And heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rainWhen we beat him death with thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chain.Now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankfulThat there's nothing but a scar round my ankleMost of all I'm glad no man will be a slave againTo a black sneak whip and thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chain.To a black sneak whip and thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chain.--- Instrumental to fade ---

Do you remember Cactus TexasNothing but a wide place in the roadEighteen wheelers never go thereMain Street's just too narrow for the load.A little town of honest peopleSome we haven't seen for quite awhileI was young and restlessAnd we both were full of dreams and running wild.We left our old hometown and familyBarely had a nickel to our nameWe were out to win the worldNot once looking back or losing aim.We hit the big town and the big timeNot a lot of effort in the deal But in the bargain we lost touch with one anotherAnd old feelings that were real.In a big house up on easy streetWhere too much never seems to be enoughWe're not the same two people far awayFrom all the days when the times were rough.Including you and IIs separated by a wallIt's not something we can talk aboutIn fact we seldom even talk at all.I don't think we realizeHow or why we ever came this farLet's go back to Cactus TexasMaybe once we're there we'll find out where we are

I've been quite the traveler ever since I hit the roadAnd the Sullen county carnival has been my earn in goldI've been quite alone since I remember whenI turned my ultimatums into chips and cashed them in.I used to run the Ferris wheel but that'd be hard to proveI can't stand to see a rolling wheel propped up so it can't moveI used to run the carousel hell that's just round and roundNever liked to see them ponies painted up and bolted down.The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leavingThe only thing that saves me from it all is I'll be goneJust when I could trust in all the things that I believe inI had to pack it up and move alongAnd I'll tell you the boys I'm not the only one.I was a straight man at the ring toss but that was just a jauntI can't see throwing rings around things you don't really wantI could run the roller coaster but that might break my heartSo much hard travelin' just to wind up where you start.Now I just work the gateway and I'm pretty satisfiedLittle booth is red and blue and I just sit insideI just take your money and give tickets out in tradeThink about my life and all the promises I made.The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leavingThe only thing that saves me from it all is I'll be goneJust when I could trust in all the things that I believe inI had to pack it up and move alongAnd I'll tell you the boys I'm not the only one.Who's running from the things they've left undone.
(Kris Kristofferson)Casey joins the hollow soundOf silent people walkin' downThe stairway to the subwayIn the shadows down below.Following their footstepsThrough the neon darkened corridorsOf silent desperationNever speaking to a soul.The poison air he's breathingHas the dirty smell of dyin''Cause it's never seen the sunshineAnd it's never felt the rain.Casey minds the arrowsAnd ignores the fatal echoesOf the clicking of the turn stopsAnd the rattle of his chains.Oh, she said, Casey it's beenSo long since I've seen youHere she said just a kissTo make a body smile.See she said I've put onNew stocking just to please youLord, she said. CaseyCan you only stay a while?--- Instrumental ---Casey leaves the undergroundAnd stops inside the Golden CrownFor something wetTo wipe away the chill that's in his bones.Seeing his reflectionIn the lives of all the lonely menWho reach for anything they canTo keep from goin' home.Standing in the cornerCasey drinks his final bitterNever glancing in the mirrorAt the people passing by.Then he stumbles as he's leavin'And he wonders if the reasonIs the beer that's in his bellyOr the tear that's in his eye.Oh, she said, I supposeYou seldom think about meNow she said, nowThat you've a family of your own.Still she said it'sSo blessed good to feel your bodyLord, she said, CaseyIt's a shame to be alone. hmm...

I've got a couple more years on you, baby,that's all.I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.And it ain't that I'm wiser,It's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall.And I've picked up a couple more years on you, baby.. that's all.I've walked a couple more roads than you, baby,that's all.And I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl.And you're headin somewhere,But I've been to somewhere, and found it was nowhere at all.And I've picked up a couple of years on you baby, that's all.Now sayin' goodbye, girl don't never come easy at all.But you've got to fly 'cause you're hearin' those young eagles call.And someday when you're older, you'll smile at a man strong and tall.And you'll say I've got a couple more years on you, baby, that's all.I've got a couple more years on you baby, that's all.You'll say I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.It ain't that I'm wiser,It's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall.And I've picked up a couple more years on you baby, that's all.

His father was a Princeton lawyerA man of meansHis mother summa-cum-laudeFormer beauty queenWith a house as big as a hotelOn Spencer boulevardThat's where he got his startEighteen years of summer campAnd private schoolsAll american golden boyWith a silver spoonHis future held all the promise of a presidentWonder where it wentIt's hard to be the crowned princeWhen it all hits homeYou can't hide behind the wallAround the throneThe real world's not a playgroundIt's a danger zoneYou find out who you really areWhen the pressures onHe's the first one in his family to wind up second bestHe couldn't pass the testHis share of the fortuneSpent on saving faceHis family comes to visitOn the holidaysSometimes it's so quite thereHe hears the flowers bloomHe's got a private roomIt's hard to be the crowned princeWhen it all hits homeYou can't hide behind the wallAround the throneInsanity is a state of mindWhere life beginsOr where it endsIt all depends

In the morning you go gunning for the man who stole your waterAnd you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the borderAnd the mourners are all singing as they drag you by your feetBut the hangman isn't hanging so they put you on the streetYou go back Jack do it again wheels turning round and roundYou go back Jack do it againWhen you know she's no high climber then you find your only friendIn a room with your two timer but you're sure you're near the endThen you love a little wild one and she brings you only sorrowAll the time you know she's smiling you'll be on your knees tomorrowYou go back Jack do it again...Now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gambling manThen you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your handYour black cards can bring you money so you hide them when you're ableIn the land of milk and honey you must put them on the tableYou go back Jack do it again...
I'm sittin' in the morning sun sittin' when the evening comesWatchin' the ships roll in then I watch 'em roll away againI'm sittin' on the dock of the bay watchin' the tides roll awayI'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wasting time Left my home in Georgia I was headed for the Frisco BayI have nothing to live for looks like nothing's gonna come my wayI'm sittin' on the dock of the bay watchin' the tides roll awayI'm sittin' on the dock of the bay wasting time Looks like nothing's ever gonna changeEverything still remains the sameI can't do what them people tell me to doSo I guess that I'll just remain the same Sittin' here restin' my bones and this loneliness won't leave me aloneTwo thousand miles I roamed just to make this dock my homeI'm sittin' on the dock of the bay watchin' the tides roll awayI'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay wasting time

Donna on my mind when I get up in the morning,Donna on my mind the whole day through,Love can't come so quick and real without any warning Wonder if she's thinking of me too. Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,Till then I'll just have Donna on my mind. Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,Till then I'll just have Donna on my mind.
I scandalized my brother While admitting that he sang some pretty songs I'd heard that he'd been scandalizing me And Lord, I knew that that was wrong. Now I'm looking at it over somethin' cool And feeling fool enough to see What I had called my brother on Now he had every right to call on me. Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy Unless you want that fiddle out of tune That picker there's in trouble boy Ain't nothin' but another side of you. If we ever get to heaven boys It ain't because we ain't done nothin' wrong We're in this gig together So let's settle down and steal each other's song. I found a wounded brother Drinkin' bitterly away the afternoon And soon enough he turned on me Like he'd done every face in that saloon. Well, we cussed him to the ground And said he couldn't even steal a decent song But soon as it was spoken We was sad enough to wish that we were wrong. Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy Unless you want that fiddle out of tune That picker there's in trouble boy Ain't nothin' but another side of you. I know that it sounds silly But I think that I just stole somebody's song She's a good timin' woman In love with a good two timin' man. And she loves him in spite of the way That she don't understand.
When I left Tulsa Jamie was an innocent young ladyGod only knows why she gave herself to a guy like youShe called me cryin' said she was gonna have your babyYou just turned your back on her like all cowards doI swore I'd get you for what you're puttin' her throughAnd the only reason I ain't got you Jamie cried and begged me not toShe still loves you for some reasonBut don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa don't let the sun set on you in TulsaIf the sun goes down on you if you're still here you're goin' down tooDon't let the sun set on you in Tulsa[ guitar ]Jamie is the only thing I ever really cared for she don't deserve this kind of shameShe's carryin' the child that you're to blame forYou just laughed and said there ain't no way it's gonna get your nameBut I swore I'd get you for what you're puttin' her throughAnd the only reason I ain't got you Jamie cried and begged me not toBut I ain't through with you yetDon't let the sun set on you in Tulsa don't let the sun set on you in TulsaBetter not let the sun set on you in TulsaDon't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
The hardest thing you ever do is love yourself that gal don't love youShe'll cause you sleepless nights and endless painBut if you don't like the rules don't play the gameEvery time that girl walks by your heart will ache your very soul will dieBut love one sided it's just yourself to blameAnd if you don't like the rules don't play the gameYou think by now I see the fool I've been given my heart a chance to winWell I do but I don't I will but I won't deep inside I know I'll do againThe hardest thing you ever do is love yourself that gal don't love youWith love one sided it's just yourself to blameAnd if you don't like the rules don't play the gameIf you don't like the rules don't play the game

Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall thinking I hear someone in my hallShe said that she'd be back in no time at all here I sit drivin' nails in the wallIn the dark that stacks around me dreams of you keep pounding meLeading me to where I've never beenAnd the voice keeps telling me this could be insanity but I know my name as well as youHere I sit drivin' nails in the wall...In the wilted patterns of my mind find that I've left you behindSowing up my torn memoriesSurviving living three bed room electric kitchen and living roomJust burning and it's on a new free wayHere I sit drivin' nails in the wall thinking I hear someone in my hallShe said that she'd be back in no time at allWhen she is back I'm gonna nail to the wall
Lord knows I am peaceful, When I'm left alone.I've always been an eagle, Been a while since I have flown.My claws are sharp as ever, So is my eagle eye.Something's gonna go tonight, When the eagle flies.Lately I've heard rumors, That the eagle may be lame.Just because I've been idle, Don't mean that I'm tame.You've jeopardized my freedom, My natural place to roost.I can fly if I have to, If they turn the eagle loose.So lay all your doubts aside, When you go to bed tonight.My feathers have been ruffled, And I'm ready for a fight.Just because I took a while to fly, Don't mean that I don't care.When you feel the shadow crossing, The eagle's in the air.So lay all your doubts aside, When you go to bed tonight.My feathers have been ruffled, And I'm ready for a fight.Just because I took a while to fly, Don't mean that I don't care.When you feel the shadow crossing, The eagle's in the air.When you feel the shadow crossing, The eagle's in the air
I made it through my rock and roll yearsWith a spent dream andA few dollar billsI don't know what I learnedI don't know what I knowAnd if I don't now I never willI ain't seen it all, but it's plain to seeI just might be an endangered speciesLike an old gray fox, I know how he feels With the new hats snapping at my heelsI ain't sure what it's all aboutI ain't in, but don't count me outThey all like to dance, but if you want to dance with meYou might be dancing with an endangered speciesI wasted some time With some women I foundAt no time ever settlin' downWith one over here and one over thereAnd that's where, nobody caresBut a man in love is what I want to beI guess, that makes me an endangered species

I hear the train a comin' rollin' round the bendI ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know whenWell I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging onWhile a train keeps a rollin' on down to San AntoneWell when I was just a baby my mama told me sonAlways be a good boy don't ever play with gunsWell I shot a man in Reno just to watch him dieWhen I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and I cryWell I'll bet there's rich folks eatin' in some fancy dining carProbably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigarsWell I know I had it comin' I know I can't be freeBut those people keep a movin' that's what tortures meWell if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mineBet I'd move it on a little farther down the lineFar from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stayThen I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

I could tell you a story from another day in timeHow a high falootin' woman tried to make me walk the lineShe was into changin' too damn hard to pleaseAnd the last time I saw her she was down on her knees.Born under the sign of the Gemini twinsThere's two sides to me and they ain't even friendsAll sides are rising and there ain't no in betweenWhen I'm bad I'm bad when I'm good I'm the best you ever seen.Sometimes I'm out a prowlin' and carryin' onToo high to know when it's time to take it homeWhen I'm like that it's hard to leave the women aloneIt ain't easy thinkin' right with a good looking wrong.For another sign of the Gemini twinsThis two sides to me and me ain't even friendsAll sides are rising in the rainbow in betweenWhen I'm good I'm good when I'm bad I'm the worst you ever seen.There's a good hearted woman waitin' when I come inShe don't wasting time and asking me about where I've beenShe keeps it all together and to wish that you could seeKnow she goes about bring it out the best side of me.Born under the sign of the Gemini twinsThere's two sides to me and they ain't even friendsAll signs are rising, and there ain't no in betweenWhen I'm bad I'm bad when I'm good I'm the best you ever seen

It's knowing that your door is always openAnd your path is free to walkThat makes me tend to leave my sleeping bagRolled up and stashed behind your couchAnd it's knowing I'm not shackedBy forgotten words and boonsAnd the ink stainsThat have dried upon some lineThat keeps you in the back roadsBy the rivers of my memoryKeeps you ever gentle on my mindIt's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be plantedOn their columns now that binds meOr something that somebody saidBecause they thought we fit together walkin'It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'When I walk along some railroad track and findThat you're movin' on the back roadsBy the rivers of my memoryAnd for hours you're just gentle on my mindThough the wheat fields and the clothes linesAnd the junk yards and the highways come between usAnd some other woman 's cryin' to her mother'Cause she turned and I was goneI still might run in silence tears of joy, might stain my faceAnd the summer sun might burn me till I'm blindBut not to where I cannot see youWalking on the back roadsBy the rivers flowing gentle on my mindI dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin'Cracklin' caltron in some train yardMy beard a roughen coal pileAnd a dirty hat pulled low across my faceThrough cupped hands round a tinCan I pretend to hold you to my breast and findThat you're waving from the back roadsBy the rivers of my memoryEver you're just gentle on my mind
Lamps in the windows burnin' bright, over in Santa Fe tonightFull moon shining down along the borderBut the ground is hard and the night is blackOver here by the railroad trackAnd I wish to the Lord that I was back in GeorgiaBlue water in the Indian sun,Calling me when the day is doneMama, mama pray for your sonAll of my life I've been toldThat the LA streets was paved with goldFame and fortune waiting to reward yaBut it didn't take long to understandCalifornia ain't the promised landBut at least a man's a man in GeorgiaBlue skies in the mornin' thereAnd there's green trees and breathin' airRockabye in my easy chairWell it seems every river in the Georgia moonlightFlowing up where folks are freeThe sun comes up through the lonely pine treesOver 'round the Kingsland ridgeI maybe here but my mind is stillAbout 90 miles north of JacksonvilleWell I may not make it, it's a long, long roadBut mama I've paid all the debts I oweAnd if I don't you know they gonna find me tryin'They took my songs and they took my soulThey made me hard and they made me oldHell I just been born, but I feel just like I'm dying
I bring it upYou're quick to cover it all up againThought we were friendsWhat are friends for?The old bones in your closetMust really embarrass youAnd so to save faceIt's a locked place[Chorus]I don't see why you don't get naked with meGet all the little secrets out in the open air'Cause we won't ever beAll that we could beAs long as you won't get naked with meThe future's gettin' shakyFrom all this holdin' backThere's something in your pastThat seems to haunt youFor better or for worse, I saidI meant it through and throughNo one has ever loved youMore than I do[Chorus]
Well he smoked those Camel cigarettes about three packs a dayNicotine stains on his fingers when he'd stretch them out to play That old "Midnight special" is one he loved to doThen he'd sing "I'm walking the floor over youTV preachers and welfare checks for him just had no placeBut he'd take his time to tune real good when he sang "Amazing Grace" He'd say boys I'm old and crazy but I still give a damnAnd I still think the boys got screwed over in VietnamHe'd drag out that old uniformAnd say "they used to call me slim"He never could get it buttoned upBut the pride looked good on himHe still feels the way he feltOver forty years agoHere's to the old manHere's to G.I. JoeHe only sang the old songs, he's standing still in time"My Phillipino baby", right there on his mindThen he'd talk about the big one, the war we didn't loseHe'd pick a little bit like Travis "Re-Enlistment blues"Here's to my old manAnd all the G.I. Joe's
Girl I can tell you're trying to work it outTryin' to get a handle on what life is all aboutBetween womenhood and nursery rhymes tryin' to find the truth in lovers liesGirl I can tell you're trying to work it outGirl I can see you're wantin' to give it a tryTaking all the good and the bad the truth and the liesFeelings inside you you can't talk about feelings have a way of not comin' outGirl I can see you're trying to work it out[ guitar ]Between womenhood and nursery rhymes looking for the truth in lovers liesAnd the ties that bind the things that last through timeGirl I can tell you're trying to work it out

Good morning, John:  Ain't it great to see your future shining brighter, Than the naked light of day? You made it, John:  But I confess there was a time we two have thought, That you might let it slip away. I love you, John:  In the cold and holy darkness, You were always shining brighter than a star.  God bless you, John: For the love and joy you've given, As the living inspiration that you are.  You scared me, John: 'Cos you've crossed so many borders into danger, With the price upon your head. They got you, John: And it hurts to see so many friends who ran, Along beside you laying dead. I know you, John: There ain't nothing you can't handle now, 'Cause there ain't nothing bigger than your heart. Keep shining, John:  For you owe it to the others as the dark, And holy wonder that you are.  Hang in there, John:  It's a rocky road to glory, But the straightest and the strongest will survive. Keep smiling, John:  We won't make it there tomorrow,  But today let's say we're lucky we're alive. I see you, John:  For the best of good intentions, Have a way of getting scattered by the wind. I mean it, John:  You might lose your mind or memory,  But you ain't gonna lose me as your friend.
Dukes Of Hazard Theme Song - Dukes Of HazardJust the good ol' boys,Never meanin' no harm,Beats all you've never saw, been in trouble with the lawsince the day they was born.Straight'nin' the curve,Flat'nin' the hills.Someday the moutain might get 'em,but the law never will.Makin' their way, The only way they know how,That's just a little bit more than the law will allow.Just the good ol' boys,Wouldn't change if they could,Fightin' the system like a two modern day Robin Hood.

People sit around and they talk and talkHow their dreams all ended too soonGuess they never hung out under the starsHowling at the moonI guess we're as different as nine and eightI see it in a different lightI don't think much about the good ol' daysJust about the good ol' nightsTalk about the good timesTalk about the times when the times were rightYou can keep the good ol' days I'll take the good ol' nights[ guitar ]They wanna go back to when a CadillacDidn't look like a ChevroletIt mean't a lot to them but not a thing to meI never owned one anywayBut a good looking woman and an old guitarWith both of them tuned just rightWell I don't think much about the good ol' daysJust about the good ol' nightsTalk about the good times...You can keep the good ol' days I'll take the good ol' nights
Everybody's going awaySaid there moving to L.A.There ain't a soul i know aroundEverybody's leaving townSome caught a freight,some caught a planeFind the sunshine leave the rainThey say this town will waste your mindI guess they're right cause it's wasted mineChorus:Some got to win,some got to loseGood time Charlie's got the bluesMy old heart keeps telling meYou ain't no kid at thirty threeYou play around and you lose your wifePlay too long and you lose your lifeI got my pills to ease the painI can't find a thing to ease the rainSometimes i'd like to try and settle downBut everybody's leaving townChorus

A long time forgotten the dreams that just fell by theWayThe good life he promised ain't what she's been living todayBut she never complains of bad times and the bad things he's doneShe just talks about the good they've haAnd all the good times to comeChorus:She's a good hearted woman in love with her good timin' manShe loves him in spite of his wicked ways she don't understandThrough teardrops and laughterThey'll pass through this world hand in handThis good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' manHe likes the bright lights the night lifeAnd the good timin' friendsAnd when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home againLord she don't understand but she does the very best that she canShe's a good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' manRepeat chorus twice
There are songs that birds don't sing to peopleThere are secrets that keep right through to the endThere are heroes who hide until foreverAnd I'm singing this song for one of themHe's the man that you passed on the road thereThe one with his life on the looseGoing either somewhere or nowhereGoing without me, without youFor he is this world's constant orphanTraveling out his lone timeLiving on apples from orchardsDying from grapes on the vineYou can find him in big city wintersDown where the mission bell criesAnd sorrow echoes through summerAs he tries to close all his eyesYou can find him in Pittsburgh in ChristmasYou can find him in Buffalo in JuneAnd he knows all the back roads between themLike the gypsy knows the moonAnd it's route 22 all over againStick your thumb out and try to look like somebody's friendLook strong at the man, gentle at the girlAnd puzzled at the rest of the worldLiving on apples from orchardsDying from grapes on the vine
Green River I've come back to you do you remember meDo you remember Molly with the soft blue eyesI left here with a lot of dreams none of them came trueWhat I wanted was here waiting all the timeGreen River did she come here every eveningLike the neighbors say she did so faithfullyGreen River has she's gone away foreverShe just disappeared one day as she gave upon meGreen River if you see her won't you tell her I'll returnAll I've brought her is myself and this little dreamPlease tell her that I love her and my lesson I have learnedGreen River tell her please come back to me
That cold north wind is blowing grey eyes you knowThe years are quickly going grey eyes you knowAnd the good life I promised you so long agoIs dead but for a dreaming grey eyes you knowWe never had much money grey eyes you knowMore rainy days than sunny grey eyes you knowAnd life has been a long hard road to hoeBut you stuck right by me smiling grey eyes you knowHard times took the blue from your eyesLeaving them grey as the winter's skiesWe've had our talk now I must walk awayLeave you here beneath this mound of clayAnd I feel so empty as I turn to goFor my heart lies there beside you grey eyes you knowMy heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know
Well I grew up lean and hungry I worked hard for my moneySaid I'm gonna live my life the way I pleaseSpent some time on the road of life saw an angel once and the devil twiceI came across some things that I don't needLike a cold hearted women whiskey in my waterAnd only one way out of a motel roomPayments on the Cadillac and too many questionsAnd old guitars that just won't stay in tuneYou know there's good and bad breaks you learn from your mistakesIt's all in how you handle them do's and don'tsA hillbilly boy is hard to convince wild and stubborn and not much senseBut I've got enough to know what I don't wantLike a cold hearted women whiskey in my water...And old guitars that just won't stay in tune
It's true you have me twisted round your finger and it seems that's where I belongYou know how to hold me to thrill me and control meJust enough to keep me hangin' onFor now tomorrow and forever I guess I'm tied to you right or wrongMy love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showingJust enough to keep me hangin' onA love that's strong as mine will make me do most anythingLike hiding tears and heartaches and dreaming silly dreamsYou've got me where you want me you keep stringing me alongJust enough to keep me hangin' on just enough to keep me hangin' on
Ramblin' aboutDown through the SouthI find things are a changing a lotEspecially meIt's easy to seeMontgomery's still hot,and I'm notI stopped by todayAt Hank Williams's graveMy hero from the days of my youthWas that him or meThat I used to beIn the times when I searched for the truth[Chorus]Hank you were my inspirationAnd I was obsessed with your waysBut to tell you the truthIt's no thanks to youThat I'm still living todayHank I still love your music And in spite of the things I've just saidYou'll always beA hero to meBut the Hank Williams syndrome is deadThe new hats are hereAnd it's increasingly clearOur day is slipping on byThey're not like me and youBut that's alright,tooThey could keep the music alive[Chorus]
He went to Paris looking for answers to questionsThat bothered him soHe was impressive, young and aggressiveSaving the world on his ownWarm summer breezes, French wine and cheesesPut his ambition at bayThe summers and winters scattered like splintersAnd four or five years slipped awayHe went to England, played the piano, and marriedAn actress named KimThey had a good life, she was a good wifeAnd bore him a young son named JimAll of the answers and all of the questionsHe locked in his attic one dayCause he liked the quiet clean country livin'And twenty more years slipped awayWar took his baby,Bombs killed his lady and left himWith only one eyeHis body was battered, his whole world was shatteredAll he could do was just cryWhile the tears were falling he was recallingAnswers that he never foundSo he hopped in a freighter, skidded the oceanAnd left England without a soundNow he lives in the islands, fishes the piling and drinksHis Green label each dayWriting his memoirs, losing his hearingBut he don't care what most people sayAfter eighty-six years of perpetual motionIf he likes you he'll smile and say"Jimmy, some of it's magic, probably tragic,But I had a good life all the way"He went to Paris looking for answers to questionsThat bothered him so

Heartache number one was when you left me I never knew that I could hurt this wayHeartache number two was when you came back againYou came back but never meant to stayI've got heartaches by the numbers troubles by the scoreEvery day you love me less each day I love you moreI've got heartaches by the numbers a love that I can't winBut the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end[ guitar ]Heartache number three was when you called meYou said that you were coming back to stayWith hopeful heart I waited for your knock on my doorI waited but you must have lost your wayI've got heartaches by the numbers...
I called you on the phone to say I love you that I stop by for you at nineMy heart broke when you said that it's all overSomeone else would take up all your timeAnd that's a lot of heartaches for a dimeI'll never know what made you change your mindI only know I've held you close and kissed you my last timeThat's a lot of heartaches for a dimeI went downtown to join the marry makers I told myself that here's where I belongI thought that I was doin' fine without you and then I heard somebody play our songAnd that's a lot of heartaches for a dime...That's a lot of heartaches for a dime
Chorus: I've had a life time of memories like you I couldn't get over even if I wanted you It's really not somethin' I don't wanna do But I've got heartaches older than you  Verse: I've seen that kind of look in other eyes before This time may be different I'm not sure Do you really understand what your young heart desires If you're just playin' around, you're playin' with fire  Chorus.

Well sometimes it's heaven And sometimes it's hell Sometimes I don't even knowSometimes I take it as far as I can And sometimes I don't even goMy front tracks're found for a cold water And my back tracks're covered with snowSometimes it's heaven Sometimes it's hell Sometimes I don't even knowHeaven ain't walkin' On a street paved with gold And hell ain't a mountain of fireHeaven is layin' In my sweet baby's arms Hell is when baby ain't thereWell my front tracks're found for a cold water And my back tracks're covered with snowWell sometimes it's heaven And sometimes it's hell Sometimes I don't even know
I'm gonna change my ways of doing things around hereI'm turning over a new leaf gonna get myself in gear'Cause I've got a woman who's better than mostAnd I've made a mess of her plansSo startin' today all I'm gonna be is her manI've been a wild catter and a go go getterBeen an SOB right down to the letterI've had misadventures I even got picturesOf even more than I can standSo startin' today all I want a be is her manI'm gonna give it all back cause all I've done is takeI've put her on the back burner while I was out on the makeBut I've got a woman who's good enough to give meA second chance againSo starting today all I'm gonna be is her manI've been a wild catter and a go go getter...I'm a little bit late but I'm wise enoughI'm taking her by the handStartin' today all I want a be is her man
Son you make me feel so proud I pop the buttons off my shirtI know I said I'd take you to the lake todayBut I'm going to have to break those plans, and it really hurtsEvery time I go fishin' it'd always start me wishin'That I could be a child againTake my 50 cents and go down to the local picture showTo watch my heroes rope and rideMost times they'd win but when they'd lose it always made me cryAin't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes dieOne by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at allWell I guess the fish just ain't bitin' just as well I don't feel like fightin'All in all it just ain't that great a fishin' day that old newspaper headlineKind of wrapped around this old heart of mine another big one got awayAnd I can't count the times he's made me laughBut this time he's made me cryThere ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes dieOne by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all
[Chorus]Hey Willie let's pack up and catch us a slow trainAnd go back to Phoenix to a far brighter dayWhere stars were for shining in the Arizona skyAnd music meant more than fortune or fameWillie, we wandered from border to borderSinging our stories and living our songsSeems the farther we go, all that grows closerIs a mind full of memories we made years ago[Chorus]We rolled through the towns like a bus load of gypsiesMotels and hotels ain't no place to stayThe favors we're taking, the money we're makingWon't pay for the living,we're giving away[Chorus]

I was a highwaymanAlong the coach roads I did rideWith sword and pistol by my side Many a young maidLost her baubles to my tradeMany a soldier shedHis lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung meIn the spring of twenty-fiveBut I am still alive I was a sailorI was born upon the tideWith the sea I did abide I sailed a schooner'Round the Horn to MexicoI went aloft and furledThe mainsail in a blow And when the yards broke offThey said that I got killedBut I am livin' still I was a dam builderAcross the river deep and wideWhere steel and water did collide A place called BoulderOn the wild ColoradoI slipped and fell intoThe wet concrete below They buried me inThat great tombThat knows no soundBut I am still around I'll always be aroundAnd around and aroundAnd around and aroundAnd around I fly a starship'Cross the Universe divideAnd when I reach the other side I'll find a place to restMy spirit if I canPerhaps, I may becomeA highwayman again Or I may simply beA single drop of rainBut I will remain And I'll be back againAnd again and againAnd again and againAnd again

(Paul Simon)I'm sittin' in the railway stationGot a ticket for a destinationOn a tour of one night standsMy suitcase and guitar in hand.And every stop is neatly plannedFor a poet and a one man bandHomeward boundI wish I was homeward bound.Home where my thought's escapingHome where my music's playingHome where my love lies waitingSilently for me.Every day's an endless streamOf cigarettes and magazinesAnd each town looks the same to meFor movies and the factories.And every stranger's face I seeReminds me that I long to beHomeward boundI wish I was homeward bound.--- Instrumental ---But all my words come back to meIn shades of mediocrityLike emptiness and harmonyI need someone to comfort me.Homeward boundI wish I was homeward bound.--- Instrumental to fade ---

There is a house down in New OrleansThey call the Rising SunAnd it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and meOh God, I'm oneMy mother was a tailorShe sowed these old blue jeansMy father was a gambler, LordDown in New OrleansThe only thing a gambler needsIs a suitcase and a trunkAnd the only time he's ever satisfiedIs when he's on a drunkGo tell my baby sisterNot to do the the things I've doneOutshine that house down in New OrleansThat they call the Rising SunThere is a house down in New OrleansThat they call the Rising SunAnd it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and meOh God, I'm one
I've been walking in the shadows for so long that I forgot the sun could shineI've turned away from everything and everyone that wanted to be mineSomehow I always shot my eyes and heart to anything that I might shareNow I'm standing still and I wonder how long have you been thereEvery path I've taken, I've turned around and quickly closed the doorIt seems that all I knew if I ever stop to feel I want moreI kept a steady run so my eyes could never focus anywhereNow I'm standing still and I wonder how long have you been thereHow long have you been standing there protecting me from loveThat shouldn't be, knowing all alone that I would realizeThat you were meant for meNow I've got to mend every broken fence and bridge that I have burnedAnd clear away the cobwebs in my heart so I can start to learnFor now I realize that you've been waiting just to teach me how to careNow I'm standing still and I wonder how long have you been thereNow I'm standing still and I wonder how long have you been there
Like a raging flood that ruins a poor man's landYou keep doing things to hurt me all you canBut the thickness that we knew is growing thin how much rain can one man standHow much rain can one man stand I gave you everything but my right handIf you won't let me love you then don't let me be your friendHow much rain can one man standI can see them big ol' storm clouds movin' inThere's a stranger in your big brown eyes againAnd you've told him that I'm just an old time friend how much rain can one man standHow much rain can one man stand...How much rain can one man stand

You want me to say I love you tooThere's nothing in the world, I'd rather doYou will never know how hard I've triedBut I can't change the way I feel inside It's nothing that you did or haven't doneWho knows what makes somebody love someoneI wish that's the way that we could beBut love is up to love and not to me I can't help the way that I don't feelTake what isn't there and make it realYou're where I should be going but my heart is at the wheelAnd I can't help the way that I don't feel It's nothing that you did or haven't doneWho knows what makes somebody love someoneI wish that's the way that we could beBut love is up to love and not to me You want me to say I love you tooThere's nothing in the world, I'd rather doYou will never know how hard I've triedBut I can't change the way I feel inside I can't help the way that I don't feelTake what isn't there and make it realYou're where I should be going but my heart is at the wheelI can't help the way that I don't feel
You know I can't stand to be around you cause you know I'm still in love with youAnd my arms keep reaching to do what my thoughts do all the timeI just can't keep my hands off of youCause it's like looking at heaven while I'm standing in hellWe shared something precious for a whileYou look just like a baby in a cradle to me I just can't keep my hands off of youWoman you've got the man inside my body trembling the way only you know how toAnd I guess that's just one of a million reasons I just can't keep my hands off of youCause it's like looking at heaven...
[Chorus:]In my own way I'm a believerIn my own way right or wrongI don't talk too much about itIt's something I keep working onI don't have too much to build onMy faith has never been that strongThere's a man in that old buildingHe's a holy man, they sayHe keeps talking about tomorrowWhile I keep struggling with todayHe preaches hell, fire and brimstoneAnd heaven seems so far awayI do believe in a higher powerOne that loves us one and allNot someone to solve our problemsOr to catch me when I fallHe gave us all a mind to think withAnd to know what's right or wrongHe is that inner spiritThat keeps us strong[Chorus]
Stayin' awake - for a week at a time, Doing them doobies and drinking that wine, I don't do it no more - I don't do it no more, Roarin' all evening - running all day, Talking so fast - I can't hear what I sayI don't do it no more - I can't do it no moreCan't do it like I done it before - I doesn't do it noMore.I don't know - if it's just my body -getting olderOr just my mind that's getting wornSo if you're thinking - of partying strong, I'm sorry to say, you can't take me alongDI don't do it no more - I won't do it no moreWon't do it like I done it before - I can't do it noMoreKeeping my eyes - on them little white line, Loving them ladies - two at a time, I don't do it no more, I can't do it no moreSearchin' the night - for a body to share, Then waking up wishing - that I wasn't there, I don't do it no more - I won't do it no more Won't do it like I done it before - I won't do it no more. Every time I hear about - some new game that they're playingIt sounds like - that same damn game - that I playedBefore, So if you're thinking - of partying strong, I'm sorry to say, You can't take me alongI don't do it no more - I can't do it no more I know you've seen me do it before - but I don't do it no moreI don't know why I done it before -But I don't do it no more.

The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at allThe sky was never blueThe stars are raindrops searching for a place to fallAnd I never cared for youI know you won't believe these things I tell youNo, you won't believeYour heart has been forewarnedAll men will lie to youYour mind cannot conceiveNow all depends on what I say to youAnd on your doubting meSo I've prepared these statements far from truePay heed and disbelieveThe sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at allThe sky was never blueThe stars are raindrops searching for a place to fallAnd I never cared for you
Silver coins that jingle jangle Fancy shoes that dance in time Oh, the secrets of her dark eyes They did sing a gypsy rhyme. Yellow clover entangled blossoms In a meadow silky green Where she held me to her bosom Just a boy of seventeen. I recall a gypsy woman Silver spangles in her eyes Ivory skin against the moonlight And the taste of life's sweet wine. Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows Stir the darkness in my mind Oh, gentle woman you sleep beside me And little know who haunts my mind. Gypsy lady I hear your laughter And it dances in my head While my tender wife and babies Slumber softly in their bed. I recall a gypsy woman Silver spangles in her eyes Ivory skin against the moonlight And the taste of life's sweet wine
So long to you, hope I don't make you blue,Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.Apart we've grown, now I can't go on alone.Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.Send the rest to my hole in the ground.I bow my head, cause in the mornin' I'm a gonna be dead.Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.Send the rest to my hole in the ground.

When I married Julie she was just seventeenPretty as the answer to any man's dreamFrom the start I gave Julie all the love that I've hadThough everyone told me that Julie was badJulie liked parties and clothes that fit tightDrinking and dancin' around late at nightShe was everything evil with the face of a childBut I sat home and waited while my Julie went wildI had built me an empire with my own two handsWith the money and power to break any manBut with all my possessions power and gold Julie was one thing I couldn't controlI gave Julie all my money could buy begged her to love me but she wouldn't tryShe'd only laugh then walk out the doorEach time she'd hurt me made me love her moreNow I'm locked in this room they say I'm insaneAnd I guess that I'll never see my Julie againI'm a man with a heart and a tormented soulAnd the mind that Julie drove out of control

South bound out of Shreveport heading hell bent for his graveHe reads a sign on the barn door that says the good lord Jesus savesBut I don't think Jesus knows him 'cause he ain't the Jesus kindHe's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mindHe gave the folks a good show at the Shreveport ColiseumThey all heard he's dying, so they all come out to seeFriends and neighbors make him happyLord them snuff queens treat him kindHe's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mindUppers, downers, turn arounders picked him up and laid him downHis old troubles keep on swimming 'cause their to damn mean to drownHe keeps looking for an answer I know he's never gonna findHe's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mindBig Bertha, back in Beaumont says he really turns her onShe hits the floor a dancing, when the DJ plays his songYou can see somebody loves him, or at least they did one timeHe's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mindUppers, downers, turn arounders picked him up and laid him downHis old troubles keep on swimming 'cause their to damn mean to drownHe keeps looking for an answer I know he's never gonna findHe's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind

I want to be free from the noise of the grindSo I live on the outskirts of the back of my mindWith a strong hand a songman and God on my sideI'm writing that freedom a line at a timeOn the highway to nowhere that runs through my mindA yellow line stretches out into the nightBroken in places it's my guiding lightSo I'm writing that freedom a line at a timeI'm walking a fine line between wrong and rightI can live with the problems of this day and timeConsider me lucky cause I'll be all rightIn my mind I'm having a beautiful lifeI'm lost in the feelings of this heart of mineIn search of the border of infinite timeAnd I find peace of mind in the songs and their rhymesSo I'm writing my freedom a line at a time
Down the street a baby just criedWhen he woke up all aloneA train's leavin' town and that lonesome old soundIs chilling me right to the bone.A song is playing I can barely hearAbout a love that's gone wrongThe freezing rain on my window paneListen they're playing my song.Taps being played by a soldier's graveSo sad it torments your soulJust listen to that north wind moanTonight it's so dark and cold.Somewhere a siren cuts through the nightSounds like a whole world's gone wrongThunder just warned but it's coming a stormListen they're playing my song

I'm lookin' for a feeling that I once had with youLookin' for a feeling I have grown accustomed toI've had love and I've had lovers but they never seem to doI keep lookin' for a feeling that I lost when I lost youI said when it was over I'd be over you in timeBecause nothing lasts forever it's all a state of mindI found one love I'll find another heaven knows how hard I've triedBut there's something always missing something never satisfiedI keep lookin' for a feeling...
Lookin' for loveI've spent a lifetime looking for youSingle bars and good time lovers, never truePlaying a fools game, hoping to winTelling those sweet lies and losing again.I was looking for love in all the wrong placesLooking for love in too many facesSearching your eyes, looking for tracesOf what.. I'm dreaming of...Hopin' to find a friend and a loverGod bless the day I discoverAnother heart, lookin' for loveWhen I was alone then, no love in sightAnd I did everything I could to get me through the nightDon't know where it started or where it might endI turn to a stranger, just like a friendI was looking for love in all the wrong placesLooking for love in too many facesSearching your eyes, looking for tracesOf what.. I'm dreaming of...Hopin' to find a friend and a loverGod bless the day I discoverAnother heart, lookin' for loveYou came a'knocking at my heart's door.. You're everything I've been looking for.. No more looking for love in all the wrong placesLooking for love in too many facesSearching your eyes, looking for tracesOf what.. I'm dreaming of...Now that I found a friend and a loverGod bless the day I discover You, oh you, lookin' for loveIn all the wrong placesLooking for love in too many facesSearching your eyes, looking for tracesOf what.. I'm dreaming of...Now that I found a friend and a loverGod bless the day I discover You, oh you, lookin' for love
I'm just a stranger in this town I'm just a drifter looking roundI might stay a lifetime or a week it all depends if I'll find what I seekYou're looking at a heart that needs a home and a little girl to love me and me aloneOne who wants a gentleman and accepts me like I amYou're looking at a heart that needs a homeI thought I had found her many times but love preserves the right to change its mindI guess perhaps my ways are strange but without this cast I can't changeYou're looking at a heart...You're looking at a heart that needs a home

The reflections of the trees are cut by the bow of my piroAnd spattered by the paddle of my eager handThat Mississippi woman is a wavin' over yonderWavin' her lantern for her Louisiana manHow I love that Mississippi woman how I love that Mississippi girlHow I love that Mississippi woman but her heart does not belong to meThe lantern light and moonbeams are dancing patterns on the waterShe doesn't seem to realize I've learned her secret plansMy jealous mind is thinking as I paddle through the sleeping alligatorsShe don't know I know about her Louisiana manHow I love that Mississippi woman...The reflections of the trees are cut by the bow of my piroAnd splattered by the paddle of my shaky handThe silence from behind me is alive with the splashing alligatorsAnd the lantern light is blinking on the bottom in the sandHow I love that Mississippi woman.How I love that Mississippi woman.

So long I've been trying to give you the things that you've wantedBut your thirst for riches is more than my pockets can standAnd I know that you're dreaming of things you could have with anotherCause to your way of thinking the money is what makes the manYou like to be seen in the richest and finest of placesYou're always embarrassed by the callouses here on my handsAnd I know that it's only a matter of time till you leave meCause to your way of thinking the money is what makes the manYou may find a rich man to give you the things that you long forBut if you're still lonely then darling you may understandThat with all of his gold he can't give you the love that I gave youFor a man can make money but money cannot make the man[ guitar ]You may find a rich man...A man can make money but money cannot make the man

He went to Paris lookin' for answersTo questions that bothered him soHe was impressive, young and aggressiveSavin' the world on his own Warm summer breezesFrench wine and cheeses put his ambition at bayThe summers and winters scattered like splintersAnd four or five years slipped away He went to England, played the pianoAnd married an actress named KimThey had a good life, she was a good wifeAnd bore him a young son named Jim All of the answers and all of the questionsHe locked in his attic one day'Cause he liked the quiet clean country livin'And twenty more years slipped away War took his babyBombs killed his lady and left him with only one eyeHis body was battered, his whole world was shatteredAnd all he could do was just cry While the tears were fallin' he was recallin'Answers that he never foundSo he hopped in a freighter, skidded the oceanAnd left England without a sound Now he lives in the islands, fishes the pilin'And drinks his Green label each dayWriting his memoirs, losin' his hearin'But he don't care what most people say After eighty-six years of perpetual motionIf he likes you he'll smile and say"There was some of it's magic, probably tragicBut I had a good life all the way" He went to Paris lookin' for answersTo questions that bothered him so
What is it that brings you to this part of town curiosity conscience or fateI know it's not love for I once gave you love and all you gave me was the gateI got a feeling you've come back to just rub it in and it really put me in my placeYou've already put big old tears in my eyes why must you throw dirt in my faceMust you keep telling me you've got a new love I don't need you to remind meMust you keep telling me I look so lonesome and that my better days are behind meMust you keep showing me pictures of him and boasting of his warm embraceYou've already put big old tears in my eyes must you throw dirt in my faceYou've already left me and broken my heart told me how much you don't want meBelieve I'm happier when we're apart why must you come back now and haunt meMust you keep showing me picturesYou've already put big old tears in my eyes must you throw dirt in my face
I grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy,And lovin' the cowboy ways.Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes,I burned up my childhood days.I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter,Don't you hold on to nothin' too long.Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them,With the words of a sad country song.My heroes have always been cowboys.And they still are, it seems.Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of,Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery,From being alone too long.You could die from the cold, in the arms of a nightmare,Knowin' well that your best days are gone.Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen,I let the words of my youth fade away.Old worn-out saddles, and old worn-out memories,With no one and no place to stay.My heroes have always been cowboys.And they still are, it seems.Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of,Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of,Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.

[Verse 1:]	She was a good looking woman no doubt	A high steppin' mover that men talk about	But everything bad in me	She brought it out	And she was just no good for me[Verse 2:]	She was wonderfully wicked and wild	With the looks of a woman	And the ways of a child	She could twist me or turn me	With a look or a smile	And she was just no good for me[Chorus:]	Don't be taken by the look in her eyes	If she looks like an angel	It's a perfect disguise	And for somebody else she may be	But she was just no good for me[Verse 3:]	I'm just a fool for a looker i guess	When it comes to beauty	Lord knows she was blessed	I thought i could change her	And i did my best	But she was just no good for me[Chorus:]
(Wayne C. Thompson - Johnny Christopher)Read in the paper nearly everydayPeople breaking up and just walking awayFrom love and that's wrong, don't you know that's wrong.A happy little home comes up for saleBecause two fools half tired and failedTo get along and you know that's wrong.A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a manAnd neither one of them try to love and understandAnd take it with a grain of salt.A little bit of love is better than no loveEven sad love's better than no loveEven bad love is better than no love at allA little bit of love is better than no loveEven bad love's better than no loveAny kind of love is better than no love at all.No love at all is a poor old manStandin' on the corner with his hat in his handAnd thare's no place to go and he's feeling lowNo love at all is a child in the streetDodging traffic and a begging to eatOn the tennament row and that's a rough row to hoe.No love at all is a scared young girlStandin' on the bridge on the edge of the worldAnd it's a pretty short fall.A little bit of love is better than no loveEven sad love's better than no loveEven bad love is better than no love at allA little bit of love is better than no loveEven bad love's better than no loveAny kind of love is better than no love at all.A little bit of love is better than no loveEven sad love's better than no loveEven bad love is better than no love at allA little bit of love is better than no loveEven bad love's better than no loveAny kind of love is better than no love at all...
I know your leavings too long overdueFor too long I've had nothing new to show youGoodbye dry eyes I've watched your plain feet off west to the moonIt felt so strange to walk away aloneNo regrets no tears goodbye don't want you back we'd only cry againSay goodbye againThe hours that were yours echo like empty roomsThe thoughts we used to share I now keep aloneI awoke last night and spoke to you not thinking you were goneAnd it felt so strange to lie awake aloneNo regrets no tears goodbyeOur friends have tried to turn my nights to dayStrange faces in your place can't keep the ghost awayJust beyond the darkest hour just behind the dawnIt feels so strange to leave my life aloneNo regrets no tears goodbye
Well I nearly got caught at a Burger KingAnd a couple of times on a planeI thought I was safe from detectionWith all of the weight I had gainedBut walking around in a jumpsuitThat didn't work worth a damnSo I bought me some Levis and grew me a beardAnd you'll never guess who I am[Chorus]Nobody knows I'm ElvisNobody knows this is meAfter all of my tries, I've gotThe perfect disguiseAnd I'm who I want to beNobody knows I'm ElvisNobody knows this is meBet you thought I was ol'WaylonWith all of my rugged good looksSwagger and walk,body and soulI bet he had what it tookI've always envied his singingThe way he played a guitarBlack vest and hat,that's where it's atThat's what I call a star[Chorus][Bridge]I want to show you Graceland,babyThat's where you ought to beI'll give you a call, but let's keep it allSomewhere between you and me[Chorus]

Was it really years ago It seems like only yesterday The last time that I saw You laugh at me and fly away. I remember all of the good times And the songs we used to sing Old friend we sure have missed you But you ain't missed a thing. Lord you should've heard the music And all the changes it's gone through But the funny thing is lately It keeps an easing back to you. But there's always something missing It'll never be the same Old friend we sure have missed you But you ain't missed a thing. They've been writin' books about you And the stories that they tell Make you look like some kind of angel But we both know you're mean as hell. I've had my share of hard times But I've lived through the strain Old friend I sure have missed you But you ain't missed a thing. People talk about you After all this time You were many things to many people But you were a friend of mine. I've been thinking bout how long You've been gone the things you've never seen But old friend I sure have missed you But you ain't missed a thing. Old buddy we sure have missed you But you ain't missed a thing

It's midnight at a liquor store in TexasI's closin' time another day is doneWhen a boy walks in the door and points a pistolMe can't find a job but Lord he's found a gun.He pulls it off with no trace of confrontationThey let the ol' man run out in the streetEven though he knows they'll come with guns a blazin'And already he can feel that great relief.Oh, how many travelers get wearyBearing both their burdens and their scarsDon't you think they'd love to stop complainingAnd fly like eagles out among the stars.He pictures the arrival of the cruisersSees that old familiar anger in their eyesHe knows that when they're shootin' at this loserThe'll be aiming at the demons in their lives.Oh, how many travelers get wearyBearing both their burdens and their scarsDon't you think they'd love to stop complainingAnd fly like eagles out among the stars.Evening news it carries all the detailsHe dies in every living room in townIn his own a bottle's thrown in angerAnd his father cries we'll never live this down.Oh, how many travelers get wearyBearing both their burdens and their scarsDon't you think they'd love to stop complainingAnd fly like eagles out among the stars.Fly like eagles out among the stars

To the people up in Texas it's the nearest thing to heaven here on earthThe lifestyle up in Texas is just go on out and live for all it's worthWhere the men are all men and the ladies there are born with ways to pleaseAnd the people up in Texas think that the rest of all the world is over seasYou don't need no one to tell you when you cross that Texas lineThe air starts smellin' sweeter and the water tastes like wineThe sun is always shining so it's seldom ever cold people just grow up there never oldYou don't need no one...The people up in Texas...Yeah the people up in Texas think that the rest of all the world is over seas
Some people are saying that time will take care of people like meThat I'm livin' too fast and they say I can't last much longerBut little they see that their thoughts of me is my SaviourAnd little they know that the beat oughta go a little fasterSo pick up the tempo just a little and take it on homeThe singer ain't singin' and the drummer's been draggin' too longTime'll take care of itself so just leave time aloneAnd pick up the tempo just a little and take it on homeWell I'm wild and I'm mean I'm creatin' a scene I'm goin' crazyI'm good and I'm bad and I'm happy and sad and I'm lazyI'm quiet and I'm loud and I'm gatehrin' a crowd and I like gravyAbout half off the wall but I learned it all in the NavySo pick up the tempo...Take it on home
Down in the place where I call homeI've been workin' my fingers to the bonePickin' white gold, pickin' white goldAll day long in Louisiana sunPickin' and a pullin' white cotton by the tonsPickin' white gold, pickin' white goldI fill my sack and I put it on my shoulderAnd then I take one againOld man cotton won't let me make a nickelTill I get it to a cotton ginSo I bent my back till I think it's gonna breakTry to keep a thinkin' how much I'm gonna makePickin' white gold, pickin' white goldThere's a little girl, I call Bellie all dayShe works alongside of mePickin' white gold, pickin' white goldHer lips are soft as a cotton in a handAnd side by side we're makin' our plansPickin' white gold, pickin' white goldThere's a little house with a little solid groundThat would make a mighty pretty homeAll we need is little money downAnd we could call it our homeI can't rest till I get throughI need the money for what it can doPickin' white gold, pickin' white goldPickin' white gold, pickin' white gold
As I wander on life's pathway know not what the future holdsAs I ponder hope grows fonder precious sacred seems unfoldPrecious memories how they linger how they ever flood my soulIn the stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfoldPrecious memories how they lingerPrecious memories how they linger
Pretend I never happenedErase me from your mindYou will not want to rememberAny love as cold as mineI'll be leaving in the morningFor a place I hope I findAll the places must be betterThan all the ones I leave behindI don't suppose you'll be unhappyYou'll find ways to spend your timeBut if you ever think about meAnd if I ever cross your mindPretend I never happenedErase me from your mindYou will not want to rememberAny love as cold as mineI don't suppose you'll be unhappyYou'll find ways to spend your timeBut if you ever think about meAnd if I ever cross your mindPretend I never happenedErase me from your mindYou will not want to rememberAny love as cold as mine

[Verse 1]Reno and Me hit the freeway,south out of town on the runReno was driving he asked me to roll him oneI turned on the radio, I found us some sweet EmmylouI sang the harmony,low down and out of keyReno just howled at the moon[Verse 2]Somewhere outside Kansas City,on a highway that leads to CheyenneThe radio put a song by a Mexican bandWell I guess we were lost in thoughts of brown skin girls,took a coupleWrong turns in a rowReno and Me just laughed and agreedIt don't matter which way you go[Chorus]It don't matter which way you go,when you're calling the highway your homeEvery old town is your past burning down,it don't matter which way you go[Verse 3]All of our old friends got married,doing all of their business in townClimbing a ladder that leads to a hole in the groundReno and Me talked it all out, one thing that we'll never knowWhat's the point of a race where you stay in one placeBelieving there's somewhere to go[Chorus: x2]
Somewhere in Vietnam a 19-year-old soldier walked out of a barroomAnd he said I must be seeing things that bourbon hit me like a baseball batIn Belfast Ireland a little lady dropped her shovel in her gardenShe raced across the yard and ask her neighbor Mrs Clancy what was thatIn Memphis Tennessee a teacher raised the window closest the riverAnd the children in her classroom swore they'd heard a choir singing down the streetIn Washington DC a private secretary's lips began to quiverAnd the President just put aside his papers and rose quickly to his feetI lay in a cheap motel in the arms of someone else's womanWhen a loud explosion rocked the room and turned the morning into nightI jumped out of bed and ran into the street with hardly any clothes onAs the sky lit up my heart stood still and I could feel my face was turnin' whiteAll at once the clouds rolled back and there stood Jesus Christ in all his gloryAnd I realized the saddest eyes I'd ever seen were lookin' straight at meI guess I was awakened by the penetrating sounds of my own screamin'And it didn't take me long to stumble out of bed and fall down on my kneesAs tears rolled down my face I cried dear God I'm thankful I was only dreamin'And if I never go to hell Lord it'll be because you scared it out of me
This highway she's harder than nine kinds of hell Light there it scares as the rain When you're down to your last shop with nothing to sell And too far away from the train. It's been a good month of Sundays and a guitar to go Had a tall drink of yesterday's wine Left a lot of good friends some sheep's in the wind And satisfied women behind. Ride me down easy Lord, ride me on down Leave word in the dust where I lay Say I'm easy, come easy go And easy to love when I stay. Put snow on the mountain, raise hell on the hill Lock horns with the devil himself Then the rodeo bum, a son of a gun And a hobo with stars in his crown. Ride me down easy Lord, ride me on down Leave word in the dust where I lay Say I'm easy, come easy go And easy to love when I stay. Ride me down easy Lord, ride me on down Leave word in the dust where I lay Say I'm easy, come easy go And easy to love when I stay...
You do the things that hurt me so right before my eyesJust because I love you so I overlook your liesLet you make a fool of me yes that's what I'll always beCause I pretend not to see what's right before my eyesEveryone keeps telling me what's right before my eyesLove is blind and I can't see what's right before my eyes[ dobro - guitar ]I can't make myself believe what's right before my eyesI thought your love belong to me but now I realizeYou couldn't care and act this way there's nothing I can do or sayJust watch my dream will fade away right before my eyesEveryone keeps telling me...
Almost out of adolescence And into a world we didn't know Not necessarily love but in trouble With a fire down below. Looking back for a feeling It's just something far away and long ago I can still recall the name But she's really someone I don't even know. But she was right for the time She was right for the time But time has a way of moving on. I do recall a gypsy lady And a younger man in over his head I was her believer taken in By every loving word she said. It was there for the first time The sweet and the bitter taste of love When you're young and alive Too much never seems to be enough. It seems the young and the innocent Are drawn like a moth to a flame To the wild and the reckless Believing they are one in the same. She never found a way To separate the good from the bad And she never understood That love was all we ever really had. She was right for the time But time has a way of moving on With her eyes on tomorrow One day she turned around and I was gone. I'd have to say in a way She just might be better off alone She was right for the time But time has a way of moving on
I remember when you said with this ring I Thee wedNow you've gone betrayed my trust rings of gold have turned to rustTears can't wash away the sin love that's dead can't live againKnowing there's no hope for us turns these rings of gold to rustLove before was clean and pure never more can I be sureYou will not betray mu trust rings of gold have turned to rustPlans we made just yesterday sands of time have chipped awayNow they've crumbled into dust rings of gold have turned to rustRings of gold have turned to rust
I was born and raised on the riverIt's the only life that I knowPeople 'round here have put a name on meAnd I hear it wherever I goThey call me river boy, river boyGood for nothin' river boyThis old world don't hold a whole lot of joyWhen you're nothin' but a river boyI do a lot of fishin' on the riverTo make my livin', you seeWhen I take my catch to the market placeThe people call out to meAnd they say, "River boy, hey, river boyYou got any fish today there, river boy?"I sell my ware but nobody caresAbout the feelin's of the river boyThere's a pretty girl, works at the market placeI see her there everydayBut when I try to talk to herI can hear her papa say"Come away from that river boy, he's a river boyNothin' but riff-raff, them river boysNo girl of mine is gonna waste her timeOn a good for nothin' river boy"So I head my boat back up the riverBack to my old fishin' placeI'm afraid this ol' river's gonna overflowFrom the tears a-fallin' down my faceI'm nothin' but a river boy, river boyA good for nothin' river boyThis old world don't hold a whole lot of joyWhen you're nothin' but a river boyRiver boy, river boyA good for nothin' river boyRiver boy [unverified]
By the banks of the river where the willows grow coldWild birds warble the strange soundin' songBy the banks of the river where the waters run coldWell that's where I first listened the lies that she toldHe lays there each night all alone and he weepsNothing ain't worse than a night without sleepThe letters she wrote him they were written in vainBut I know that her conscience still echoes my nameIf the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were fishesI'd lay there for hours in the cold rainy matchesIf the ladies were squirrels yeah with a big bushy tailI'd fill up my shotgun with a rock salt and nailsWe'd fill up our shotgun with a rock salt and nails
There's a road runs clear to the skyCalls to my spirit, calls to my heartShe's been a harbor, a port in a stormShe's got one more sundown and one more dawnFiddles don't make violinsMotel rooms don't make homesYou can't turn water into wineYou can't make a rock from a rolling stoneYou'd be a liar if you said you'd changedThere's a river of freedom running through your veinsBut she'll be there in your heart and your mindTill the last song fades and the music diesFiddles don't make violinsMotel rooms don't make homesYou can't turn water into wineYou can't make a rock from a rolling stoneYou can't make a rock from a rolling stone
She was a flower for the takin', Her beauty cut just like a knifeHe was a banker from Macon, He swore he'd love her all a his lifeHe bought her a mansion on the mountain, With a formal garden and a lot a landBut paradise became her prison, that Georgia banker was a jealous man!Every time he'd talk about her, You could see the fire in his eyesHe'd say, "I would walk through Hell on Sunday, to keep my Rose in ParadiseHe hired a man to tend the garden, And keep an eye on her while he was goneSome say they ran away togetherSome say that gardener left aloneNow the banker is an old manThat mansion's crumbling downHe sits all day and he stares at the gardenNot a trace of her wasEver foundEvery time he'd talk about her, You could see the fi-er in his eyesHe'd say, "I would walk through Hell on Sunday, To keep my Rose in ParadiseNow there's a rose out in the gardenIts beauty cuts just like a knifeThey say that it even grows in the winter timeAnd blooms in the dead of the night
You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hairRuby, are you contemplating going out somewhereThe shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going downOh, Ruby don't take your love to town.It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian warBut I was proud to go and do my patriotic choresI know Ruby, that I'm not the man I used to beBut Ruby, I still need your company.It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzedAnd the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realizeBut I've heard them say it won't be long until I'm not aroundOh Ruby, don't take your love to town.She's leaving now for I just heard the slammin' of the doorThe way I know I've heard it slam a hundred times beforeIf I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the groundOh Ruby, don't take your love to town

Disappointments weigh so heavy leave its wreckage all aroundOnce a good man once respected sorrow breaks a good man downHad a good love had a good life now the sadness all aroundDread the darkness hate the daylight sorrow breaks a good man downI remember all the good times when the world was ours to flameThen she left me took the sunshine every night wind speaks her nameCan't stop loving can't stop living there's no answer to be foundNo ambition just existing sorrow breaks a good man downI remember all the good times...Sorrow breaks a good man down

A tiger always walks at night and marks his prey while everything's stillHe waits until it's unaware and then he strikes and makes his killThat's the way you've done me girl you never let me brieveCouldn't feel the way I felt so you'd tried to punish meBaby it's time to straighten my mindA spider's always busy spinning webs that no one can get throughSomehow that spider always has reminded me babe of youYou took the love I gave you but you'll never let it liveThat's the hang of girl you know how to take but not to giveBaby it's time to straighten my mind[ trumpet ]You've kept me like a river always clinging to the groundI've got to get away from you before I sink and drownBaby it's time to straighten my mind
Oh such a waste of love true love and devotionOh such a waste of love on a heart so cold with no emotionI might as well just wrap it up and wash it down the drain'Cause the little happiness I knew just wasn't worth the painYou build me up and for a little while you let me liveBut love is the only thing I find you never learned to giveOh such a waste of love...Oh such a waste of love...
This place is too damn lonesome I think I'll change and go out for a whileOn second thought where could I go with a closet full of clothes that's out of styleIt's another night of TV or another night of nothin' on my handsI gotta change my way of thinkin' 'cause I'm still thinkin' like a married man[Chorus]Suddenly singleIt's hard to break old habits for the badIf I wasn't over thirtyI might just move back in with mom and dadI should call on some old flame, oh that ain't as easy as it soundsMy body says I need someone but I heart ain't ready for someone right nowMaybe in the mornin' I'll wake up and see the lightSmall consolation Lord for the way I feel tonight[Chorus]Suddenly singleSomeone's always right when someone's wrongAnyway you look at itI'm suddenly alone
(Kris Kristofferson)Well, I woke up Sunday mornin' with no wayTo hold my head that didn't hurtAnd the beer I had for breakfast wasn't badSo I had one more for desert.Then I fumbled through my closet to my clothesAnd found my cleanest dirty shirtAnd I shaved my face and combed my hairStumbled down the stair to meet the day.Well, I'd smoke my mind the night beforeWith cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickingBut I lit my first and watched the small kidCussing the can that he was kicking.Then I crossed the empty street and caughtThe Sunday smell of someone frying chickenAnd it took me back to somethin'That I'd lost somehow, somewhere along the way.On the Sunday morning sidewalkWishing Lord, that I was stoned'Cause there's something in a SundayMakes a body feel alone.And there's nothing sure to dyingHalf as lonesome as the soundOn the sleeping city sidewalkAnd Sunday morning coming down.In the park I saw a daddyWith the laughin' little girl that he was swingingThen I stopped beside a Sunday schoolListened to the songs they were singing.I headed back for home and somewhere far awayA lonely bell was ringingAnd it echoed through the canyonsLike the disappearing dreams of yesterday.On the Sunday morning sidewalkWishing Lord, that I was stoned'Cause there's something in a SundayMakes a body feel alone...
I left the old farm down in TexasAnd bummed all around for a timeThen one day I found myself staringAt a sign that read Sunset and VineThe big cars and the beautiful womenPut beautiful thoughts in my mindI decided to be a great actorOn the corner of Sunset and VineThen a man with a cigar approached meAnd he put his face right to mineAnd declared a great star hit this coverOn the corner of Sunset and VineWell, I thought he was right for a whileFor the band seemed to thrill with each lineAnd they put my name in the sidewalkNear the corner of Sunset and VineNow six wives and six divorces laterI'm down to one very thin dimeAnd I wish I was back home in TexasAnd I'd never seen Sunset and WineI wish I'd never seen Sunset and Vine

I come from the countryGrew up over [?]There are places I ain't welcomedAnd I had to loot and cryI slipped in the back doorStill I never got my shareBut the blues don't careMy best friend had to tell meWhat I could never seeWhat that woman did the bestWas run around on meI had to learn the hard wayThat all in love ain't fairBut the blues don't careThe blues don't careNow the blues don't careYou can curse and complainTill it drives you insaneBut the blues don't careI tried to reach for higher groundNever dream that I could fallI believed that I could flyHigh above it allTalk about hitting bottomBrother I have been thereAnd the blues don't careI laughed and talked with JesusTold it all to HimI am afraid I told Him too muchFor Him to let me inChances are he'll lose my numberWhen the roll is called up thereBut the blues don't careBut the blues don't careNo, the blues don't careYou can curse and complainYou can say it just ain't fairBut the blues don't careThe blues don't care

There's a Bible on the dresser and a sign hung on the doorAnd a woman in my arms shouldn't beI'm to the point of no returning but I've been here beforeThis cheatin' life is nothing new to me.There's someone to be considered I call her on the phoneAnd say the job is taking longer that I plannedI don't have the heart to tell her that a stranger's turned me onAnd I'm headin' for the broken promise land.Tonight I'm crossing over and I'll reach the cheatin' sideAnd I'll hate myself for coming here againWhere the streets are paved with misery and lives are built on liesA place they call the broken promise land.Found a note left on the dresser and a key left in the doorOn the floor I found her golden wedding bandGuess she finally had to tell me she's not waiting anymoreAnd she's headin' for the broken promise land.Tonight she's crossing over and she'll reach the cheatin' sideAnd I'll hate myself for coming here againWhere the streets are paved with misery and lives are built on liesA place they call the broken promise landAnd it's more than I can stand
I only meant to love you don't you know it babeWhy couldn't you be contented with the love I gaveI've given you my heart and now you want my mindYour love scares me to death girl it's the chokin' kind.You can kill a man with bullets poison or a knifeBut it hurts him more to take his pride and run his lifeWhatever it is you want girl I hope you findBut that hat don't fit my head it's the chokin' kind.When you fall in love again girl take a tip from meIf you don't like the peaches walk on by the treeFind what you want and keep it treat it sweet and kindBut let it breathe don't make your love the chokin' kind.

Just a kid with a song when he wandered from home In search of the phantom of fameShe promised she'd wait but he got back too lateJust a scene from the dark side of fameIn the wrong frame of mind he took to the wineHolding pieces of love's broken chainIt was colder than jade in this world that he'd madeAll alone on the dark side of fameHis songs were soon curled on the lips of the worldThey earned him the highest of claimAnd yet his greatest desire was the simple warmth of love's fireCause it's cold on the dark side of fameThe wine took its toll and soon he grew old much younger than most people doBut there's no trace of shame in the sound of his nameThough he lived on the dark side of fame he lived on the dark side of fame

When I noticed her the first timeI was outside running barefoot in the rainShe lived in the house next doorAnd her nose was pressed against the window paneWhen she looked at meShe smiled and showed a place, where two teeth used to beAnd I heard her, ask her momIf she could come outside and play with meWe became as one andHad a love without beginning or an endAnd every day she lived with meWas like a new day dawning once againAnd I've loved her sinceEvery doll was Shirley TempleSoda pop was still a nickelJam was on her fingertipsMilk was circled on her lipsAfter many years our love grew silentAnd at night I heard her cryWhen she left me in the fallI knew, that it would be our last goodbyeI was man enough to give her everythingShe needed for a whileBut in searching for a perfect loveI found that I could not give her a childAnd I've loved her sinceEvery doll was Shirley TempleSoda pop was still a nickelJam was on her fingertipsMilk was circled on her lipsNow she lives a quiet life And is the mother of a little girl And every time I pass her house My thoughts go back into another world. I can see her little girl Her nose is pressed against the window pane. She thinks I'm a lonely man Who wants to come inside out of the rain.
Saw your picture in the paper and i see you married goodAnd i know that he can give you all the things i never couldBut i know that he can't give you what you need most of allSo the door is always open,and the lights on in the hall[Chorus]Yes the door is always open and the lights on in the hallAnd you know that i'll be waiting,if you ever come to callWhen night falls on that mansion and you're lying in his bedWhen he begs you for attention,will you think of me insteadWhen he reaches out to touch you,is your face turned to the wallWell the door is always open,and the lights on in the hall[Chorus: x2].

[Verse 1]Lord knows i am peaceful when i'm left aloneI've always been an eagle,been awhile since i have flownMy claws are sharp as ever,so is my eagle eyeSomethings gonna go tonight,when the eagle flies[Verse 2]Lately i've heard rumors that the eagle may be lameJust because i've been idle don't mean that i'm tameYou've jeopardized my freedom,my natural place to roostI can fly if i have to,if they turn the eagle loose[Chorus]So lay all your doubts aside,when you go to bed tonightMy feathers have been ruffled and i'm ready for a fightJust because i took awhile to fly don't mean that i don't careWhen you feel the shadow crossing,the eagle's in the air[Chorus]When you feel the shadow crossing,the eagle's in the air
He was born and raised around Jacksonville a nice young man bout the kind to killBut the jealous fight and the flashing blades sent him on the run through the EvergladesRunning like the dog through the evergladesWhere a man can hide and never be found and never have fear of the baying houndsBetter keep moving don't stand still if the skeeters don't get him in Gators-villeIf the skeeters don't get him in the Gators-villeWell the Posy went in and he came back outAnd said he'll die and there ain't no doubtIt's an eye for a nice so the death is fate in month-less long in the evergladesA man can't live in the evergladesBut a man can hideNow the years went by and his girl was wedHis family gave up they thought he was deadNow and then the people would say they had seen him running through the evergladesRunning like the dog through the evergladesWhere a man can hide
They said in her younger daysHer beauty was enough to drive men wildBut the hunger in her body thenWas not the hunger of some lonely child.Like a butterfly in springtimeSearching every field for loving's sweetest roseThe embrace of many strangersStill could not release her from the hold.In the backstreets and the bedroomsAll she's found is disappointments bitterlyWhile the love that she's too often foundWas enough to satisfy her needs.She's older than the years she holdsAnd ageing fast with each day passing byOn a downhill run to nowhere'Cause the hunger never can be satisfied.The reflection in her mirror's not the imageShe remembers in her mindHer beauty has been eaten by the hungerAnd the acid winds of time.She has danced the tune her demons playedAnd payed the piper dearly for his songEmpty now of all her pride but still insideHer hunger's just as strong.They said in her younger daysHer beauty was enough to drive men wildBut the hunger in her body thenWas not the hunger of some lonely child
(Ed Bruce - Ron Peterson)This is the last cowboy songThe end of a hundred year waltzThe music is sad as they're singing alongAnother piece of America's lost.He rides a feed lot and clerks in a marketOn weekends selling tobacco and beerHis days're spent surrounded by fencesBut he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here.The Old Chisholm Trail is covered by concreteThey truck 'em to market in fifty foot rigsThey blow by his market never slowing to reasonLike living and dying was all he did.This is the last cowboy songThe end of a hundred year waltzThe music is sad as they're singing alongAnother piece of America's lost.This is the last cowboy songThe end of a hundred year waltzThe music is sad as they're singing alongAnother piece of America's lost.This is the last cowboy song...
Why do you treat me as if I were only a friendWhat have I done that has made you so distant and coldSometimes I wonder if you'll be contented againWill you be happy when you are withered and oldI can't offer you diamonds or mansions so fineAnd I can't offer you clothes your young body craveBut if you'd love me and say that you'll always be mineThink of the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save honeyWhen you are weary and tired of another man's goldIf you ever get lonesome remember this letter my ownBut don't try to answer though I've suffered sorrow untoldIf you don't love me I wish you would leave me alone

Back home the family's eatin' dinner there's a fire in the fireside warm and brightBut I won't be there today cause I've got a debt to payAnd they don't let black sheep stray from the roadNo they don't let black sheep stray from the roadMy throat is out crying for water Lord that wind is blowing coldThat guard is watching me like a hawk up in the treeAnd I'm longing to be free from the road yes I'm longing to be free from the roadEvery bone inside my body's aching and that guard don't care if I live or dieHe told me yesterday son don't try to get awayFor I'll lay you down to stay by the road yes I'll lay you down to stay by the road
Like a muddy river running wild and deepYou've got a flaming memory that keeps burning meJust when I think you love me, doubt creeps inI still feel the shadow of your distant friendIt's a major heartache when you lose your trustWhen you love the feeling, it begins to rustJust when the sun is shining, clouds set inI still feel the shadow of your distant friendI still feel the past each time you touch meWill the fire in your mind never end?I'm so afraid our love may turn to ashesI still feel the shadow of your distant friendYou know I really love you, but your heart's confusedBy that aching fever that keeps haunting youJust when I think it's over, it starts againI still feel the shadow of your distant friendI still feel the past each time you touch meWill the fire in your mind never end?I'm so afraid our love may turn to ashesI still feel the shadow of your distant friend

When it comes to our love all hope is goneI guess a friend is all I meant to beI just can't find the right touch for turning you onOr the words or the ways that could make you love meThe ways of this old world are not always fairAnd most things are never what we hope to findIn search of a feeling that never was thereI went out of my way to go out of my mindWhen it comes to our love all hope is goneI guess a friend is all I meant to beI just can't find the right touch for turning you onOr the words or the ways that could make you love meThe ways of this old world are not always fairAnd most things are never what we hope to findIn search of a feeling that never was thereI went out of my way to go out of my mindThe ways of this old world are not always fairAnd most things are never what we hope to findIn search of a feeling that never was thereI went out of my way to go out of my mind

Just two good ole boys,Never meaning no harm.Beats all you never saw, been in trouble with the lawSince the day they was born.Straightenin' the curves,Flattenin' the hills.Someday the mountain might get 'em but the law never will.Makin' their wayyyyyy, the only way they know how.Well, that's just a little bit more than the law will allow.Just two good ole boys,Wouldn't change if they could.Fightin' the system like two modern day Robin Hoods.

There are still places where people like me can hang outWith nothing at all in this whole world to worry aboutThey ain't tore 'em all down yet and said every man for himselfOr polished them up until nothing worth keeping is left.They ain't got 'em allIf you try here and thereYou'll still find a few holes in the wallThere an endangered species but I'm keeping trackI can tell you that they ain't got 'em all.There are still women who can walk up and change your waysWho don't even know they're impossibly beautiful girlsWho for some crazy reason will hold you so close in the night'Til nothing else matters and you finally start feeling all right.They ain't got 'em allThey're still there and their wantin' and wonderfully willing to fallThere an endangered species but I'm keeping trackI can tell you that they ain't got 'em all.They ain't got 'em allIf you try here and thereYou'll still find a few holes in the wallThere an endangered species but I'm keeping trackI can tell you that they ain't got 'em all
I came down with broken heart, just to start to my summer.Boy when you lose the one you love, it's a stone cold bummer.I just called you up to tell you I don't know what to say.I wish you knew the way I felt.[Chorus]This is gettin' funny, but their ain't nobody laughin' honey, Come on back home.Tell me how you feel, though I can't stand this at all.Can't you see its a mystery, I thought I was your lover.Yes I could fly, I could lay down and die,Six one way, half a dozen of the other.I could say I'm sorry baby, enough's enough.I'm gonna break right down and ball.[Chorus]Tell me how you feel, though I can't stand this at all.I was out to show you what I good man I could be,You were out to hurt somebody.Now I'm going crazy. Really did, and I ain't lying.Get's so lonesome here in L.A., my summer's turned to autumn.I don't if you heard it way out there were you you stay,My heart just hit rock bottom.I'm runnin' round in circles, I don't know where I am.Won't you at least give me a call.[Chorus]Tell me how you feel, though I can't stand this at all.How do you feel? I can't stand this all.
This time if you want me to come back, it's up to youBut remember I won't allow the things you used to doYou're gonna have to toe the mark and walk the lineThis time will be the last timeThis time if I should feel unwanted, I won't stayEach tomorrow will depend on the love you give todayIt's all up to you to keep in mindThis time will be the last timeThis time should be anything like the other timesThis time will be the last timeIf this time should be anything like the other timesThis time will be the last time

Just like the sun over the mountain top you know I'll always come againYou know I love to spend my morning time like sunlight dancing on your skinAnd I have never gone so long just for telling lies to youWhat you've seen is what I've beenThere is nothing that I can hide a few you see me better than I canOut on the road that lies before me now there are some turns where I will spinI only hope that you will hold me now till I gain control againJust like a lighthouse you must stand alone and mark the sailors journey's endAnd no matter what sea that I've been sailing on I'll always roll this way againOut on the road that lies...
With iron in my brain I'd laid down to rest not caryin' if I live or dieWoke up a freezin' with rain pourin' down so hard I can open my eyesI been chased from the yard with dogs at my heels searchin' for shelter at timesBut there's nothing so hard for a man on the bum as the time between bottles of wineThe time between bottles of wineBeggin' for pennies just one sweet taste of the nectar that kills the man's soulSweet piece of mind excuses my pride just somethin' that keep out the coldIt's too late for me to start living again the good life is too far behindI never remembere the things that I've had till the time between bottles of wineThe time between bottles of wine[ guitar ]If mama could see me she wouldn't believe I even resemble her sonShe would throw her life to make me a man and she's proud the child that she's doneWhat one love created another destroy the story is older than timeThe tale of a man who just can't stand the time between bottles of wineThe time between bottles of wine the time between bottles of wineThe time between bottles of wine

It was winter time in Nashville down on Music City RowI was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the coldTo warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soulAnd keep the chilly winds off my guitarMy thirsty wanted whiskey and my hunger needed beansBut I guess it'd been a month of payday since I heard that eagle screamSo with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreamsI left my pride and stepped inside a barActually I guess you'd call it a tavernCigarette smoke to the ceiling sawdust on the floor friendly shadowsI saw that there was just an old man sittin' at the barIn the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitarHe said come up here boy show us what you are I said I'm dry he bought me a beerHe nodded at my guitar said it's a tough life ain't it I just looked at himAnd he said you ain't makin' any money are you I said you been readin' my mailHe just smiled and said let me see that guitarI got somethin' you oughta hear then he laid it on meIf you waste your time a talkin' to the people who don't listenTo the things that you are sayin' who do you thinks gonna hearAnd if you should die explainin' how the thing they complain aboutOr the things they could be changing who do you thinks gonna careThere were lots of other singers in the world turned deaf and blindWho were crucified for what they tried to showNow their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of timeAnd the truth remains that no one wants to knowWell the old man was a stranger but I'd've heard his song beforeBack when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the doorNo one stood behind me but my shadow on the floorAnd lonesome was more than a state of mindYou see the devil haunts a hungry manAnd if you don't want to join him well he's gotta figure out someway to beat himAnd I ain't sayin' I beat the devil but I drink his beer for nothin'And then I stole his songYou can still hear me singin' to the people who don't listenTo the things that I am sayin' prayin' someone's gonna hearAnd I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain aboutAre things they could be changin' hopin' someone's gonna careI was born to be a singer and I'm bound to die the sameBut I've got to feed this hunger in my soulIf I never have a nickel I won't even die in shame'Cause I don't believe that no one wants to know
Today I started loving you again I'm right back where I've really always beenI got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mendAnd today I started loving you againWhat a fool I was to think I could get by with only these few million tears I criedI should have known the worst was yet to comeAnd that crying time for me had just begunOh today I started loving you again...I got over you just long enough...
Each night I leave the barroom when it's over not feeling any pain at closin' timeBut tonight your mem'ry found me much too soberI couldn't drink enough to get you off my mindTonight the bottle let me down let your memory come aroundThe one true friend that I thought I'd found tonight the bottle let me downI've always had a bottle I could turn to lately I've been turning every dayBut the booze don't take effect the way it used toI keep a hurtin' in an old familiar wayTonight the bottle let me downTonight the bottle let me down

On a long and lonesome highway east of OmahaYou can listen to the engine moanin' out its one note songOr you can think of the woman, the girl you knew the night beforeyour thoughts will soon be wondering the way they always doWhen your ridin' sixteen hours and there's notning much to doAnd you don't feel much like ridin' you just wish the trip was throughHere I am on the road againThere I am up on the stageHere I go playin' star againThere I go turn the pageWell you walk in to a restaurant strung out from the roadYou can feel the eyes upon you as your shaking off the coldYou pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explodemost times you can't hear 'em talk other times you canAll the same old cliches is that a woman or a manAnd you always seem outnumbered you don't dare make a standHere I am on the road againThere I am up on the stageHere I go playin' star againThere I go turn the pageLater in the evening as you lie awake in bedThe echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your headYou smoke the days last cigarette tryin' to remember what she saidsay here I am on the road againThere I am up on the stageHere I go playin' star againThere I go turn the page
You load the horses I'll pack the riggerLet's tell 'em goodbye and walk out the doorOne drink and one kiss can lead to too manyWe ought to know cause we been there beforeEight hours of ridin' will put us in HoustonTwo hours of sleep to make it or bustEight seconds of glory you stay in the moneyAnd five year old whiskey to wash down the dustThat ain't no hill for a couple of climbersThat's all we ever intended to beThat ain't no hill for a couple of climbersTwo old sidewinders like you and meLet's find us a place and a couple of ladiesSomeone to lie to someone to trustSomeone who's impressed by a couple of outlawsWho's gold plated trophies have turned into rustNow we're damned near broke and we keep buyin' whiskeyDo you think they might settle for a bottle of wineWell those two over there right there by the jukeboxYours don't look back hoss but just look at mineThat ain't no hill for a couple of climbers...
Two streaks of steel stretchin' cross the land too far to reach for my baby's handI stood and watched her disappear and in the distance I could hear whooeTomorrow I'll see coming down the trackThat same old train that she ain't coming backFor her sweet love that once was mine faded just like a whistle's whine whooeTwo streaks of steel I've been standing besideWhere all that mattered in my life just diedI want to lay across those tracks when that trainCrossed those two streaks steel once againTwo streaks of steel took my love away no reason now for me to want to stayNext time I'll hear that whistle moan that all my troubles will be gone whooe whooe

My woman goes about her way hangin' on from day to day God knows she's triedTo do her best for her and me knowin' that she'll always be unsatisfiedShe tells me everything's alright but when she should be sleepin' nightsI've heard her cryBut she greeds me like the morning sun makes me wish I was the one unsatisfiedBut soon the warmer wind will blow her way I knowAnd warm her like she never has been warmed beforeLord she deserves the very best with me she'll never be addressed we'd tried and triedBut a man can tell when somethin's wrong woman can go just so long unsatisfied[ steel ]Soon the warmer wind will blow her way I knowAnd warm her like she never has been warmed beforeShe deserves the very best with me she'll never be addressed God knows I've triedBut I can't be what I can't be she can't live a life with me unsatisfied unsatisfiedUnsatisfied unsatisfied
Got me a rocker without no armsOl' wood stove to keep me warmMy firewood out of the rainI sit and watch the seasons changeThere's a woman in Little RockGot plenty of money down in her sockShe come to see me time to timeWe sit on the porch and drink our wineA man ought to know when he's got it allHolding it down up in ArkansasCoyotes howl in the nightThe rats ate my food but that's alrightThey must have needed it more than meAin't no sweat I'll eat their cheeseWay back in the woods a hoot-owl callsMaking his rounds up in ArkansasThe eagle flies wild and freeCatches fish down in my creekI watch him rise on the breezeI don't bother him he don't bother meWalmart moves into townProgress can't keep it downTourists come from miles aroundI sit on the porch,the sun goes downBut I live way back from it allDoing alright up in Arkansas
Like a sail that's torn and can't ride the windHere I stand looking both ways againI'm a dollar short on a three dollar nightTurning left because I ain't got no rightI keep thinking this time may be itBut somehow all the pieces just won't fitBut I'll always have a dream to hold on toJust as long as I keep waking up with youYou told me once that storms never last I know it's true, oh so trueJust when I think the clouds will never passLike a silver lining you come shining throughI know you'll always be there right or wrongTogether we'll keep on keeping onAnd I'll always have a dream to hold on toJust as long as I keep waking up with youYou told me once that storms never last I know it's true, yes I doJust when I think the clouds will never passLike a silver lining you come shining through And I'll always have a dream to hold on toJust as long as I keep waking up with you
I hear the echo of your footsteps they're right in step with marching timeSince you've walked out of my life and out of my world please walk on out of my mindI know you're hidin' there in the darkness and it's got me running scared and blindSince you've walked out of my life out of my world please walk on out of my mindYou've got footprints all over my mem'ries I must erase them if I canYou keep stumbling through my hopes and dreams kickin' around my future plansYou've got me walking round in circles looking for something I'll never findSince you've walked out of my life and out of my world please walk on out of my mind
After carefully considerin' the whole situationI stand with my back to the wallWalkin' is better than runnin' awayAnd crawlin' ain't no good at all.If guilty's the question, truth is the answerI've been lyin' to me all aloneThere ain't nothin' worth savin' except one anotherAnd before you'll wake up I'll be gone.'Cause after carefully considerin' the whole situationAnd I stand with my back to the wallWalkin' is better than runnin' awayAnd crawlin' ain't no good at all.Mm, mhm, walkin' is better than runnin' awayAnd crawlin' ain't no good at all
When we dance together my world's in disguiseIt's a fairyland tale that's come trueWhen you look at me girl with those stars in your eyesI could waltz across Texas with youWaltz across Texas with you in my armsWaltz across Texas with youLike a storybook ending I'm lost in your charmsAnd I could waltz across Texas with youMy heartaches and troubles are just up and goneThe moment you come into viewWith your hand in mine dear I could dance on and onAnd waltz across Texas with youWaltz across Texas with you in my arms
It's been a long timeSince I've had a good timeAnd I think it's high time I didCould I have this danceIt feels like romanceAnd it's good to be feeling like thisThe lights are down lowThe band's playin' slowTo The beautiful Tennessee WaltzHow many love songsAnd how many dance floorsHave lovers like us waltzed acrossChorus 1:So waltz me to heaven tonightTo the waltz of the angels we'll blissfully blindOn past the milkyway to paradiseWon't you waltz me to heaven tonightChorus 2:Waltz me to heaven tonightHonky tonk angels in heavenly flightWith the moon as our halo and the stars in our eyesWon't you waltz me to heaven to - night.Chorus 3:Waltz me to heaven tonightHold your heavenly body against mine so tightAs the band softly plays on this magical nightWe'll dance past the milkyway to paradiseWith the moon as our halo and the stars in our eyesWon't you waltz me to heaven tonightWon't you waltz me to heaven tonight
(Waylon Jennings)I've been thinking it over wondering what to doUp to now I've been leaving it up to youBut you'll always be the way you've always been I ain't got the time to go through that again.I've been wasting time and I'm to blameLiving with things I couldn't change And the one conclusion I've come toI've been wasting time and a lot of good love on you.I've made up my mind to make my moveIt's just a waste of time to wait on youI'm set to leave and you're set in your waysYou can't change and if you can't I can't stay.I've been wasting time that I can't spareWastin' love when you don't careAnd the one conclusion I've come toI've been wasting time and a lot of good love on you.I've been wasting time and I'm to blameLiving with things I couldn't change And the one conclusion I've come toI've been wasting time and a lot of good love on you...

About fourteen miles out of AbileneAt a curve in the road and a little streamI found out what love's aboutSo long ago wonder what I found outWe all got together at the Buffalo GapGranpa Gus ain't got no lapHe went to heaven in a rocking chairWhat a surprise if he ain't the only one thereYou've got a man over eight feet tallHe can sleep in the kitchen with his feet in the hallYou ain't much more than five feet twoI bet you can do anything you've a mind toThis little song means nothing to youWouldn't matter at all if you wanted it toJust part of my life and part of the showAin't that good but I thought you might want to know
I can hear the wind a blowing in my mindJust the way it used to sound Through the Georgia pinesAnd you were there to answer when I called You and me we had it allRemember how I used to touch your hair?While reaching for the feeling That was always thereYou were the best thing in my life I can recall you and me we had it allI know that we can never live those times againSo I let my dreams take me back To where we have beenThen I'll stay with you girl as long as I canOh it was so good oh it was so good Oh it was so good when I was your manI'll never stop believing in your smileEven though you didn't stay It was all worthwhileYou were the best thing in my life I can recall you and me we had it allYou and me we had it all
Boy, this week sure had a lot of MondaysI ain't never seen it quite so hardGetting over a Sunday beforeI guess there's a simple solutionGood times sometimes just endWe made it as loversThat's as close as we've ever beenWe made it as loversWe just couldn't make it as friendsThe hardest part of broken romancesIs having to learn all those brand new dances
Honey how you've changed it makes me wonder have I ever really known youHow could you abuse and use the kindeness and tenderness that I have shown youIf I have known then I have shown the strength on which my love could make a standBut you've mistaken tenderness and kindness for the weakness in your manI can give you almost anything if I know what you're looking forI can give you everything any other man can give and moreHe may promise you the world but I can give you everything he canSo don't mistake my tenderness for any sign of weakness in your man[ guitar + harmonica ]I may live my life alone with walls of stone inside some lonely cellBut no man's gonna take the love I own and never live to tell the taleSo don't forsake the vows you made and don't remove my little golden bandAnd don't mistake my tenderness for any sign of weakness in your manDon't mistake my tenderness for any sign of weakness in your man
(Johnny Wright - Jack Anglin)The days have been long and I have been lonesomeRecalling the dreams that never came trueNights have been lonely but now that's all over'Cause I've payed my debt for trusting in you.Every day your mem'ry grows dimmerClouds drift away, sunshine peeps throughEvery night no longer you'll haunt meMy conscience is clear, what about you?--- Instrumental ---It's hard to believe that you are the same oneThat once meant so much that I loved so trueIt's hard to know I've worshipped to wrong oneBut I've paid for it what about you.Every day your mem'ry grows dimmerClouds drift away, sunshine peeps throughEvery night no longer you'll haunt meMy conscience is clear, what about you?--- Instrumental ---Every day your mem'ry grows dimmerClouds drift away, sunshine peeps throughEvery night no longer you'll haunt meMy conscience is clear, what about you?...

What makes me want to roam when I got so much love at homeWhat makes a man wander what makes a man wanderThe whistle of a train does something to my brainWhat makes a man wander what makes a man wanderI know I love you as much as I ever could love anyone yet I'm still goneI come back and I vow to settle down now then I'm gone with the dawnWhat makes me want to roam when I got so much love at homeWhat makes a man wander what makes a man wander[ guitar ]I know I love you as much...Oh what makes a man wander what makes a man wander
Staring at the doorEvery night I'm thinking more and moreAbout walking out that door.I know some day I willAlthough I'm standing still someday I willI know someday I will.As right as we were we are wrongNothing's going to change what we've doneThe only thing that keeps me from going, babeIs wondering what you'll do when I'm gone.There's somethin' in your eyesI swear your eyes are tellin' me goodbyeGoodbye is in your eyes.You can call it prideBut my thoughts of someone else here by your sideThat's killing me inside.As right as we were we are wrongNothing's going to change what we've doneThe only thing that keeps me from going, babeIs wondering what you'll do when I'm gone.Staring at the doorEvery night I'm thinking more and moreAbout walking out that door

As we sat on the front porchOf that ole gray house where I was born and raisedAnd stared out at the dusty fieldsWhere daddy's always worked hard every dayI think it kinda hurt him when I said daddy there's a lot that I don't knowBut don't you ever dream about a life where corn don't growHe just sat there silent staring in his favorite coffee cupI saw a storm of mixed emotion in his eyes when he looked upHe said son I know at your age it feels like this old world is turning slowAnd you think you'll find the answer to it all where corn don't growBut hard times are real there's dusty fields no matter where you goYou may change your mind cause the weeds are high where corn don't growI remember feeling guilty when daddy turned and walked back in the houseI was only seventeen back then but it seems like I knew more than I do nowI can't say he didn't tell me this city life's a hard row to hoeIt's funny how a dream can turn around where corn don't growBut hard times are real...You may change your mind cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow
Time keeps changing lanes and shifting gearsRacin' down the road that disappearsWhere do we go from here?Sometimes, it's hard to live like I was [Incomprehensible]Tryin' to survive these modern daysThe old fashioned wayTime keeps changing lanes and shifting gearsRacin' down the road that disappearsWhere do we go from here?
There's a photograph in a gold frame on the mantleI've never seen two people more in loveWhat a stark contrast to the picture of us standingOn the edge of giving in and giving upSomething so real don't just disappearIf it goes away it must go somewhereTill we find the answer, we've got to hold onWhere does love go when it's gone?Where does love go when it's gone?Life's a long highway with a lot of private placesThere's times that we've both thought of finding oneBut there ain't no way we're giving up foreverIt's like saying there won't be a rising sunSomething so real don't just disappearIf it goes away it must go somewhereTill we find the answer we've got to hold onWhere does love go when it's gone?Where does love go when it's gone?
(Jim Owen)If my years were less, if my shoes were newI'd pack my things and I'd leave youHitch myself to some westbound trainYou'd never see me here again.If I could dream as I once couldI'd be gone gone for goodI don't want to live, haven't another tryIn some old house where love has died.We once had love, it's gone nowDon't know when, don't know howWe're two strangers under one roofNo need to like it, we both know the truth.Love has gone, there's nothing leftI wanna leave, I can't help myselfI don't want to live haven't another tryIn some old house where love has died.Too many ghosts walk the floorGhosts of the love that ain't no moreI'd like to have what we once hadAnd there ain't no use, that's too bad.You're too much a part of meFor me to be ever freeWe keep living but never tryIn some old house where love has died...
(Paul Kenerley)Well, I guess I've been blessed with good luck and fortuneAll that I have is more than enoughI've tried to work hard but it ain't been easyBut compared to most it ain't been too rough.I've had it all Lord knowsI'm thankful the life that I lead is some kind of dreamI've got buses and trucks and stuffs that all make loud noisesWhy I even own things that I ain't never seen.And it fills me with pride when I hear them sayThere goes a good ol' boy who made it throughI count my blessings with each of your kissesWhen you add it all up where would I be without you.You helped me along like an angel of mercyMy nature is such that I could've strayedBut your tender love has always controled meWhere others would leave you always have stayed.And it fills me with pride when I hear them sayThere goes a good ol' boy who made it throughI count my blessings with each of your kissesWhen you add it all up where would I be without you.Where would I be without you...

You take the lady...I'll take the lessonI can't say that anyone's...Doin' me wrongCause I allways knew....That the girl had a weaknessFor whistlers and jugglers....and singers of songsNow she was a child...Back when I first met herAnd the woman inside her...Was just bein' bornAnd I knew she'd come with me...Cause she had a feverFor whistlers and jugglers...and singers of songs.And the whistler will whistle her...A song she can dance toAnd jugglers will cheer her...When she starts to cryThe singer will sing her.....A bed of red roses]Where she might let you....lie by her sideShe'll laugh in the face...of the wealthy and famousAnd you'll never lose her..To the handsome or strongBut all of your life son...Watch over your shoulderFor whistlers and jusgglers...and singers of songas..Repeat the chorus..........
In the white room with black curtains in the stationBlack roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlingsSilver horses, brightening moonbeams in your dark eyesDawn light smiles on you leaving my contentment I'll wait in this place where the sun never shinesWait in this place where the shadows run from themselves You said no strings could secure you in the stationPlatform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windowsI walked into such a sad time at the stationAs I walked out felt my own need just beginning I'll wait in this place where the sun never shinesLie with you where the shadows run from themselves

Straight out of nowhereAnd a little bit out of our mindsWe were courting disasterWith one foot over the lineIt was one for the showAnd two for ol' shorty and meWe were the wild onesWe had this town up a tree[Chorus]We were the wild onesThe ones they couldn't controlWe were survivorsGood hearts - body and soulWe were the winners'Cause we didn't know we could failWe were the wild onesAnd we had the world by the tailShe was a ladyWhen a lady wasn't easy to beHangin' in limboShe started hangin' with meWe were the music'Cause we had a song we could singWe were the wild onesAnd we had the world on a string[Chorus]We were the wild onesAnd we had the world by the tail
Through the chill of winterRunning across the frozen lakeHunters are out on his trailAll odds are against himWith a family to provide forThe one thing he must keep aliveWill the wolf survive?Drifting by the roadsideClimbs each storm and aging faceWants to make some morning's fateLosing to the range warHe's got two strong legs to guide himTwo strong arms keep him aliveWill the wolf survive?Standing in the pouring rainAll alone in a world that's changedRunning scared, now forced to hideIn a land where he once stood with prideBut he'll find his way by the morning lightSounds across the nationComing from your hearts and mindsBattered drums and old guitarsSinging songs of passionIt's the truth that they all look forThe one thing they must keep aliveWill the wolf survive?Will the wolf survive?

Every since the day I was big enough to put my pants on by myselfYou could find me somewhere with the radio turned onThen one night I gave my heart to an old beat-up guitarIt never left my arms till I was almost grownI had to try my hand as a workin' man tried to be my daddy's sonBut my mind was packed and gone and headed southMomma said I'll pray for you then she said goodbyeTo the only one out of seven that didn't work outNow I'm way down hear in Dixie playing honky tonk musicKeepin' some joint a jumpin' every night of the weekLord knows it's hard to keep a dance hall woman happyWhen you're drinkin' a little too much and you're workin' cheapWell I ain't done a thing I can brag about to anyone back homeJust another night club singer with a real good bandIf a jealous woman don't kill me and momma keeps on prayin'Someday I might be more than what I amNow I'm way down hear in Dixie,When you're drinkin' a little too much and you're workin' cheap
Well the road can be a circus,a death defying actBut the clowns don't come around no more since the monkeys off my backI stand here on the stage,as the house lights fade to blackYour love helps me forget,i'm working without a net[Chorus]Up on the high wire,i hear the crowd begin to callSome want you to fly,some want to see you fallNow and then i stumble,but i ain't fallen yetYour love helps me forget,i'm working without a netI used to depend on some things i did not needI leaned on some crutches that kept me off my feetStanding here without them now,well it scares me half to deathYour love helps me forget,i'm working without a net[Chorus: x2]
We'll build the world of our own that no one else can shareAll our sorrows will leave far behind the stairsAnd I know you will find there'll be peace of mindAnd we'll live in a world of our ownClose the door light the lights we'll stay at home tonightFar away from the bustle and the bright city lightsLet the world fade away just leave us aloneAnd we'll live in a world of our ownWe'll build the world of our ownOh my love oh my love I've cried for you so muchLonely nights without sleeping while I long for your touchNow your lips can erase the heartache we've knownCome with me to the world of our ownWe'll build the world of our ownAnd I know you will find there'll be peace of mindAnd we'll live in a world of our own
(David A. Coe)Would you lay with meIn a field of stoneIf my needs were strongWould you lay with me?Should my lips grow dryWould you wet them, dear?In the midnight hourIf my lips were dry?Would you go away to another landAnd walk a thousand milesThrough the burning sand?Wipe the blood away from my dying hand?If I give my love to youWill you bathe with me in the stream of lifeWhen the moon is fullWill you bathe with me?--- Instrumental ---Will you love meWhen I a'm down and outIn my time of trialsWill you stand by me?Would you go away to another landAnd walk a thousand milesThrough the burning sand?Wipe the blood away from my dying hand?If I give my love to youWill you bathe with me in the stream of lifeWhen the moon is fullWill you bathe with me?...

It was a picture perfect weddingWe had the whole world at our feetEveryone thought we were headingDown a lovers easy streetWe'd have a house out in the countryA picket fence, the whole nine yardsThey said our love would last foreverIt was written in the starsWrongI should have known it all alongWhen the future looks to bright can't be anything but rightWrongI was all but devastatedWhen she told me we were throughIn a while the heartache fadedAnd I found somebody newI swore that this time would be differentI had it all figured outI wouldn't make the same mistakesI knew what love was all aboutWrongI should have known it all alongWhen the future looks to bright can't be anything but rightWrongEverything was going strongThe sky was always blue I thought my dreams had all come trueWrongWrong
I'm not here to forget youI'm here to recall the things we used to say and doI don't want to get over youI walk the same places we used to goAlone at a table for twoI don't want to get over youThey oughta give me the Wurlitzer prizeFor all the silver I let slide down the slotPlaying those songs so blueHelp me remember youI don't want to get over youA fresh roll of quartersSame old songMissing you through and throughI don't want to get over you

I remember the day that Clayton Delaney diedThey said for the last two weeks that he suffered and criedIt made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kidThey said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he didClayton was the best guitar picker in our townI thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton aroundI often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to meNever took his old guitar and made it down in TennesseeWell daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understandI knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece bandClayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar awayThere ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early grayI guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink boozeI can see him half stoned pickin' up the Lovesick BluesWhen Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehowI'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me nowI remember the year that Clayton Delaney diedNobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I criedI know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I doBut it could be the good Lord likes a little picking tooI remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
If my years were less if my shoes were new I'd pack my things and I'd leave youHitch myself to some westbound train you'd never see me here againIf I could dream as I once could I'd be gone gone for goodI don't want to live haven't another try in some old house where love has diedWe once had love it's gone now don't know when don't know howWe're two strangers under one roof no need to like it we both know the truthLove has gone there's nothing left I want to leave I can't help myselfI don't want to live haven't another try in some old house where love has diedToo many ghosts walk the floor ghosts of the love that ain't no moreI'd like to have what we once had and there ain't no use that's too badYou're too much a part of me for me to be ever freeWe keep living but never try in some old house where love has died

Long ago and far away In my ol' common labor shoes I turned the world all which a way Just because you asked me toLike unto no otherFeel simple love is simple true There's no end to what I'd doJust because you asked me[Chorus]Let the world call me a fool But if things are right with me and you That's all that matters And I'll do anything you asked me toKnowing how much I love you And after all that I've been through I'd turn and walk away from you Just because you asked me to(Lord, I hope you'll never do) [Chorus]
I've walked through many towns with fortunes lost and foundSeen the beauty of this land made by nature and by menBut when I leave I don't look back for I've only left my tracksI've crossed the burning bridges and walked through miles of sandSeen the lawlest in the law you beat all I ever saw[ guitar ]I've dreamed a million miles about your eyes and smilesI know I've loved the best I can't be content with lastI've scanned the skies of blue for just one glimpse of youBut they threw away the mold of a love that's grown so coldYour heart would never thought you beat all I ever saw
[Chorus:]You can have her, I don't want herShe didn't love me anywayShe only wanted someone to play withAll I wanted was love to stayThe girl I love, up and left meShe ran away with my best friendComes home at night, for just one hourWhen daylight comes she's gone again[Chorus]When you're stuck with the wrong womanThere ain't much that you can doJust dig a hole and crawl right in itThen pull the ground right in over you[Chorus]Life without love is might emptyBut confession is good for your soulI'd rather have love for just one hourThen have the world and all it's gold[Chorus x2]
You're the one who took the timeLooked for a reason to believeFive hundred pounds of [?]Which shines on the better side of meMore than anyoneYou're a part of all I say and doWhen it's all said and doneWhen they remember me, they'll think of youYou always believedThat's what brought me up when I was downAnd I do believeYou deserve the stars in my crownYou always believedThat's what brought me up when I was downAnd I do believeYou deserve the stars in my crownAnd I do believeYou deserve the stars in my crown
I blew in from TexasAnd you don't know who I amMost of you could care lessAnd the rest don't give a damnBut you might take special noticeWhen you take a look at meI'm everything you've ever beenAnd ever want to beMy game is the winner take allI live on the edgesSo I'm subject to a fallI ain't never been a loserI ain't never gonna beI'm like runnin' in a ringerYou don't mess around with meI've got money in my pocketI've got money in the bankIf I look like a poor boyI've got much more than you thinkI got a woman on my right armWoman on my leftWhen it comes to women,LordI just can't help myselfI know it's not the right thing to doBut I could never changeEven if I wanted toSo if you are a ladyAnf if you always want to beI'm a living lovin' legendYou don't mess around with meShe's got honey drippin' off her lipsSo good you can tasteA walkin' aphrodisiacToo damn good to wastePrancin' like a thoroughbredOut to win the raceIt don't matter how good lookin'Or how good she may beThere's just one foregone conclusionYou don't mess around with me
I work so hard to win myself a place in life And leave behind the slums and povertyNow I have wealth a fancy home a pretty wifeShe loves the ground I walk on but she don't love meYou like the places that I take you don't you girlAt last you were you've always longed to beYou're very much at home here in this kind of worldYou love the ground I walk on but you don't love meAnd I know just what would happen if there came a dawnThat I was broken down and out I'd reach and you'd be goneDon't worry girl that kind of dawn will never comeYou'll always have the things you want from meBut it's so sad to know that when we're all aloneYou love the ground I walk on But she don't love meYou love the ground I walk on But she don't love me
There'll come a time girl you'll look for me in each horizon in each face you seeYou'll look for love like love used to be there'll come a time girl you'll look for meLook all around you if you have the time look at me once more if you canYou once said you loved me now you've changed your mindBut you'll change your mind againThere'll come a time girl...There'll come a time girl...
You have her now she's your life you're saying how she'll be your wifeAnd I wish I could be happy for youBut you see my friend I've been there too that's one more thing that'll bother youWhen she treats you like she's treated me you'll think of meWhen the new wears off and the glamor's goneBut the ties that bind keep holding on and they're strongYou'll think of me being with her like I thought of her being with themAnd you and God knows whoYou're happy now but wake and see when she treats you like she's treated meAs you wake to see who the next will be you'll think of meAs you wake to see who the next will be you'll think of me
