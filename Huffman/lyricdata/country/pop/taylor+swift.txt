I'm so glad you made time to see me.How's life, tell me how's your family?I haven't seen them in a while.You've been good, busier then ever.We small talk, work and the weatherYour guard is up and I know why.Because the last time you saw meIs still burned in the back of your mind.You gave me roses and I left them there to die.So this is me swallowing my pride,Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.And I go back to December all the time.It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.I go back to December all the time.These days I haven't been sleepingStaying up playing back myself leaving,When your birthday passed and I didn't call.And I think about summer, all the beautiful timesI watched you laughing from the passenger sideAnd realized I'd loved you in the fall.And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.So this is me swallowing my pride,Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.And I go back to December all the time.It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.I go back to December all the timeI miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,And how you held me in your arms that September night,The first time you ever saw me cry.Maybe this is wishful thinking,Probably mindless dreamingBut if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.I'd go back in time and change it but I can'tSo if the chain is on your door, I understand.But this is me swallowing my pride,Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,And I go back to December.It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.I go back to December all the time all the time

You take a deep breathAnd you walk through the doorsIt's the morning of your very first dayYou say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhileTry and stay out of everybody's wayIt's your freshman yearAnd you're gonna be here for the next four yearsIn this townHoping one of those senior boysWill wink at you and say, "you know I haven't seen you around, before"'Cause when you're fifteen,Somebody tells you they love youYou're gonna believe themAnd when you're fifteenFeeling like there's nothing to figure outCount to tenTake it inThis is life before you know who you're gonna beAt fifteenYou sit in class next to a red-head named AbigailAnd soon enough you're best friendsLaughing at the other girlsWho they think they're so coolWe'll be out of here as soon as we canAnd then you're on your very first dateAnd he's got a carAnd you're feeling like flyingAnd you're mama's waiting upAnd you're thinking he's the oneAnd you're dancing around the room when the night endsWhen the night ends'Cause when you're fifteen,Somebody tells you they love youYou're gonna believe themAnd when you're fifteenAnd your first kiss makes your head spin aroundBut in your life you'll do thingsGreater than dating the boy on the football teamBut I didn't know it at fifteenWhen all you wantedWas to be wantedWish you could go backAnd tell yourself what you know nowBack then I swore I was gonna marry him somedayBut I realized some bigger dreams of mineAnd Abigail gave everything she hadTo a boy who changed his mindAnd we both cried'Cause when you're fifteen,Somebody tells you they love youYou're gonna believe themAnd when you're fifteenDon't forget to look before you fallI've found time can heal most anythingAnd you just might find who you're supposed to beI didn't know who I was supposed to beAt fifteenLa la la la laYour very first dayTake a deep breath girlAnd take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

Do you remember the dayI leaned up against your carAnd it started rolling down the streetYou screamed and ran after itAnd tried to open the doorAnd it ran over your footAnd I was too busy laughing on the ground to see. It would take Brad Pitt to leave youIt takes five seconds to need youWhen I'm mad at all the lovebirds'Cause they don't know to play our songI wish that pretty girls couldn't see youI wish that all your roads would lead you right to me'Cause that's where you belongUntil Brad Pitt comes along Do you remember the time we watched CarrieAnd you said it reminded you of meAnd I threw the remote at youAnd you said "my point exactly"And later on that night, under the neon city lights, You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me. It would take Brad Pitt to leave youIt takes five seconds to need you When I'm mad at all the lovebirds'Cause they don't know to play our songI wish that pretty girls couldn't see youI wish that all your roads would lead you right to me'Cause that's where you belongUntil Brad Pitt comes along You call me lucky 'cause I lose everythingBut I swear I'd be careful with itIf you gave me a ring And it would take Brad Pitt to leave youIt takes five seconds to need youWhen I'm mad at all the lovebirds'Cause they don't play our songI wish that pretty girls wouldn't see youI wish that all your roads would lead you right to me'Cause that's where you belongUntil Brad Pitt comes along'Til Brad Pitt comes alongYeah, oh ohUntil Brad Pitt comes along
He said the way my blue eyes shinedPut those Georgia stars to shame that nightI said: "That's a lie."Just a boy in a Chevy truckThat had a tendency of gettin' stuckOn back roads at nightAnd I was right there beside him all summer longAnd then the time we woke up to find that summer had goneBut when you think "Tim McGraw"I hope you think my favorite songThe one we danced to all night longThe moon like a spotlight on the lakeWhen you think happinessI hope you think "that little black dress"Think of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meSeptember saw a month of tearsAnd thankin' God that you weren't hereTo see me like thatBut in a box beneath my bedIs a letter that you never readFrom three summers backIt's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweetAnd lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believeBut when you think "Tim McGraw"I hope you think my favorite songThe one we danced to all night longThe moon like a spotlight on the lakeWhen you think happinessI hope you think "that little black dress"Think of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meAnd I'm back for the first time since thenI'm standin' on your streetAnd there's a letter left on your doorstepAnd the first thing that you'll readIs when you think "Tim McGraw"I hope you think my favorite songSomeday you'll turn your radio onI hope it takes you back to that placeWhen you think happinessI hope you think "that little black dress"Think of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meOh, think of meMmmYou said the way my blue eyes shinedPut those Georgia stars to shame that nightI said, "That's a lie."
Verse1:You take all the words you said to her and put them up as a wall of gray, protecting yourself from the world that you believe in, I didn't know you would be able to say all the things you did so I take them and put them up as a wall of gray, protecting myself from the world I believe inChorus1:She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, while you ignored the world and listend to the fray, and you said you wouldn't be embarassed if you said that word again but we both go embarassed when we said her nameVerse2:The words written on the wall didn't have anything against anybody, were not in a war so what are we fighting for, I don't know so just shut-up and say all the thing you've wanted to say, the page filled with words in gray and it's about youChorus2:I've never been anywhere cold as you, you give rainy endings to perfect days, that's why I hate you for who you areVerse3:If you were the only thing I needed we wouldn't be this way, so she just said everything, everybody wanted her to say, but I'm not gonna say it oh, no, no, noChorus3:She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, you promised me everything I wanted but you gave it to everybody else instead, but you never gave us a damn thing so we cry, cry alone or is it together I don't know

I used to rule the worldSeas would rise when I gave the wordNow in the morning I sleep aloneSweep the streets I used to own I used to roll the diceFeel the fear in my enemy's eyesListen as the crowd would sing"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!" One minute I held the keyNext the walls were closed on meAnd I discovered that my castles standUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells a ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explainOnce you go there was neverNever an honest wordAnd that was when I ruled the world It was the wicked and wild windBlew down the doors to let me inShattered windows and the sound of drumsPeople couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries waitFor my head on a silver plateJust a puppet on a lonely stringOh who would ever want to be king? I hear Jerusalem bells a ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the world I hear Jerusalem bells a ringingRoman Cavalry choirs are singingBe my mirror, my sword and shieldMy missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explainI know Saint Peter won't call my nameNever an honest wordBut that was when I ruled the world

It's strange to think the songs we used to singThe smiles, the flowers, everything... is gone.Yesterday I found out about youEven now just looking at you... feels wrongYou say that you'd take it all back Given one chance, it was a moment of weakness And you... said yes!  You should've said noYou should've gone home You should have thought twice before you let it all goYou should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd- get back to me(Get back to me)And I should've been there, in the back of your mindShouldn't be asking myself why! You shouldn't be begging for forgivness at my feetYou should've said noBaby and you might still have me You can see that I've been cryin' Baby you know all the right things... to sayBut do you, honestlyExpect me, to believe... We could ever be the same?You say that the past is the pastYou need one chance, it was a moment of weaknessAnd you... said yes!  You should've said noYou should've gone home You should have thought twice before you let it all goYou should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd- get back to me(Get back to me)And I should've been there, in the back of your mindShouldn't be asking myself why! You shouldn't be begging for forgivness at my feetYou should've said noBaby and you might still have meOh oh oh I can't resit! Before you go tell me thisWas it worth itWas she worth... this? No... oh no.No no no... oh, no You should've said noYou should've gone home You should have thought twice before you let it all goYou should've known that word 'bout what you did with her'd- get back to me(Get back to me)And I should've been there, in the back of your mindShouldn't be asking myself why! You shouldn't be begging for forgivness at my feetYou should've said noBaby and you might still have me

I heard a songTonight on the radioAnother girl sings about a boyShe sees his faceIn every space, every roomAnd I know That if I turn around You won't be thereIf I close my eyesWill you be there? Chorus:I don't wanna lose your faceI don't wanna wake up one dayAnd not remember what time erasedI don't wanna turn aroundCause I'm not scaredOf what love gave me and took awayAnd I don't wanna lose your face I've got a picture of youIn my bedroomI hope it never fallsI hope I never lose that feelingI used to get when you calledAnd now I wonder to myselfWho were you, where are you?Were you ever here at all? Chorus:I don't wanna lose your faceI don't wanna wake up one dayAnd not remember what time erasedI don't wanna turn aroundCause I'm not scaredOf what love gave me and took awayAnd I don't wanna lose your face That girl in the songHad it so goodI wish I could close my eyesAnd see youI wish the sky had your faceAnd the oceans had your eyesAnd the sunset had your lipsAnd I had you Chorus:I don't wanna lose your faceI don't wanna wake up one dayAnd not remember what time erasedAnd I don't wanna turn aroundCause I'm not scaredOf what love gave me and took awayAnd I don't wanna lose your faceOh, no, noI don't wanna lose your faceI don't wanna turn around Oh, oh, oh yeahOh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh yeah
When I see your smileTears run down my face I can't replaceAnd now that I'm stronger I've figured outHow this world turns cold and breaks through my soulAnd I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one I will never let you fallI'll stand up with you foreverI'll be there for you through it allEven if saving you sends me to heaven It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.Seasons are changingAnd waves are crashingAnd stars are falling all for usDays grow longer and nights grow shorterI can show you I can be the one I will never let you fallI'll stand up with you foreverI'll be there for you through it allEven if saving you sends me to heaven Cuz you're my, you're my, my true love, my whole heartPlease don't throw that awayCause I'm here for youPlease don't walk away, Please tell me you'll stay, stay Use me as you willPull my strings just for a thrillAnd I know I'll be okThough my skies are turning grey I will never let you fallI'll stand up with you foreverI'll be there for you through it allEven if saving you sends me to heaven I will never let you fallI'll stand up with you foreverI'll be there for you through it allEven if saving you sends me to heaven I will never let you fallI'll stand up with you forever
