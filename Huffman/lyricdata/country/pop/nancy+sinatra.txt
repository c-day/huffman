I know I stand in line until you thinkYou have the time to spend an evening with meAnd if we go someplace to danceI know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with meAnd afterwards we drop into a quiet little placeAnd have a drink or two......And then I go and spoil it all by sayingSomething stupid like I love you I can see it in your eyes that you despiseThe same old lines you heard the night before......And though it's just a line to you for me it's true......And never seemed so right beforeI practice everyday to find some clever linesTo say to make the meaning come true......But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets lateAnd I'm alone with youThe time is right your perfume fills my head......The stars get red and on the nights so blue......And then I go and spoil it all by sayingSomething stupid like I love you

There's a little bird that somebody sentDown to the earth to live on the windGoing on the wind and he sleeps on the windThis little bird that somebody sentHe's light and fragile and feathered sky blueSo thin and graceful the sun shines throughThis little bird who lives on the windThis little bird that somebody sentHe flies so high up in the skyWay out of reach of human eyeAnd the only time that he touches the groundIs when that little birdIs when that little birdIs when that little bird dies

You Only Live Twice or so it seems, One life for yourself and one for your dreams. You drift through the years and life seems tame, Till one dream appears and love is its name. And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on, Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone. This dream is for you, so pay the price. Make one dream come true, you only live twice. And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on, Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone. (from James Bond 007 - You Only Live Twice, 1967)This dream is for you, so pay the price. Make one dream come true, you only live twice.
