Got a call from my friend She saw my picture again In a magazineWe laughed out loud 'cause she said "Remember when,This was all a silly dream??"Now I wake up every day In a different cityA smile on my face Somebody pinch meShe said "all the world's a stage"But girl you know, Those cameras n lights won't ever change meI don't drink champagne When I'm back home with my friendsWe sip on tea on the porch'cause I'm still the girl next doorNo fancy things when I come off tourI slip back into my jeans'cause I'm still the girl next doorIt's amazin' to hear people singin' alongHear the radio playin' my songI still get butterfliesStill get nervous insideIn the spotlightNow every now n then On a Friday nightCruisin' down to the dive barWe waste the night awaySpend Saturday sleepin' in lateThose were the good daysI don't drink champagne When I'm back home with my friendsWe sip on tea on the porch'cause I'm still the girl next doorNo fancy things when I come off tourI slip back into my jeans'cause I'm still the girl next doorAnd even when I'm miles awayI'll always have the roots from where I came 'cause when it all fades awayMy home will still be the same, yeah eh yeahI don't drink champagne When I'm back home with my friendsWe sip on tea on the porch'cause I'm still the girl next doorNo fancy things when I come off tourI slip back into my jeans'cause I'm still the girl next door [Chorus: x2]
Would it bother you to know his hands have been all over me,And would it bother you to know I'll run to him next time you leave, oh yeah.When you hit the road and disappear, and leave me here.I'm not sure what you're doing out there, or who you're doing it with.Oh you're probably at some sweet hotel with some groupie whore, But what the hell, or maybe that's just something I tell myself.When I run my nails down his back, and he kisses me on my neck, He feels me, but it kills me.Such a bittersweet, passion pain, I bite my lip not to scream your name, oh baby.I feel everything, but guilty. Would it bother you to know He drinks your southern comfort when you're gone, oh yeah.Would it bother you to know He picks up your guitar and plays your songs, oh yes he does.And I wear your band t-shirt to bed, Imagine I'm with you instead, but you're not here. No you're never here.Oh you're probably at the back of your bus, satisfying your all night lust, But maybe that's just something I tell myself.When I run my nails down his back, And he kisses me on my neck, He feels me, but it kills me.It's a bittersweet, passionate pain, I bite my lip not to scream your name, oh baby.I feel everything, but guilty. Would it bother you to know he says, He's in love with me.When I run my nails down his back, And he kisses me on my neck, He feels me, but it kills me.It's a bittersweet, passion pain, I bite my lip not to scream your name, oh baby.I feel everything, but guilty. Oh ohWould it bother you, yeah
[Verse 1]I'd given up on loveI'd given up on meEverything for you was never as it seemedI was running out of reasonsI was running out of timeI thought I'd stopped believingThen you showed me the light [Chorus]You found me in the darkest nightYou're my angelYou saved my lifeI can't believe we're standing hereWhat's mine is yours, and yours is mineI love you till the end of timeI wanna spend forever with youI doI doI do [Verse 2]I can see usGrowing old and greyStanding beside youWhen we walk through heaven's gatesCause soulmates live togetherFrom one life to the nextWe'll always be togetherI promise you this [Chorus]You found me in the darkest nightYou're my angelYou saved my lifeI can't believe we're standing hereWhat's mine is yours, and yours is mineI love you till the end of timeI wanna spend forever with youI doI doI do [Bridge]They always say "you'll know when you know"I didn't know it could feel like thisWith every touch, with every kiss You found me in the darkest nightYou're my angelYou saved my lifeI can't believe we're standing here [Chorus]You found me in the darkest nightYou're my angelYou saved my lifeI can't believe we're standing hereWhat's mine is yours, and yours is mineI love you till the end of timeI wanna spend forever with youI doI doI do
