Too sweet to be forgotten what could have been could beToo right to be too wrong for me and too real to be only a sweet memoryThe moon is just another candle to read my feelings byReflecting on leftover yesterdays my how time does flyYou're welcome in all of my daydreams so nice to have on my mindWhy should I try to forget you you're almost all that I left behindToo sweet to be forgotten...So until you find another playground you're welcome to play on my mindWhy should I try to forget you you're almost all that I left behindToo sweet to be forgotten...
Let me tell you all I know about a feelingEverybody oughta know about a feelingYou can't live with it You can't live without it feelingYou can't buy it you can't beg it You can't borrow it or steal itLet me tell you all about a feeling called loveOh now it can make you feel Like you've never felt beforeIt can make you walk the line And it can make you walk the floorIt ain't no better for the rich man Than it is for the poorSo get a little feel for a feeling called loveI'm talkin' you all I know about a feeling...[ guitar ]It's what's missin' if you're lonely That you keep on searching forAnd it's everything you've never been But what could make you so much moreSo if you're not afraid to find out What you're made ofSo get a little feel for a feeling called loveAnd find out all I know about a feeling...
Don't be angry with me, you darlingIf I fail to understandAll your little whims and wishes all the timeJust remember, I'm kind of dumbI guess like any foolish girlAnd my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mineNow I recall the first timeThat you flirted with me, dearAnd you jokingly said, "Come and be my bride"But now the time has turned the pagesWhy, it's the sweetest joke on earthBut I have you here forever by my sideAnd maybe someday you're gonna hurt meWell, I've been hurt in love beforeOnly God can know and time alone will tellBut in the mean time, well, I'll be loving youWith all my heart and soulAnd pray God to let it last if it's his willSo don't be angry with me, you darlingIf I fail to understandAll your little whims and wishes all the timeJust remember, I'm kind of dumbI guess like any foolish girlAnd my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mineYes, my head stays sorta foggy 'cause you're mine

Hello little bluebird I know how you feelOne time I thought I'd never learn tooBut someone came along and helped me like I'm helping youAnd if I can fly I'll bet you can tooI don't know what misfortune kept you down this timeBut there's usually a reason for it allYou'll run into things that hurt you all the timeAnd the higher up the harder that you fallFirst thing you have to do is be sure you wanna flyCause no one in the world can do it for youThen practice what you learn by doin' all that you can doCause if I can fly I'll bet you can tooI don't know what misfortune...So go spread your little bluebird wings and fly awayMay the melodies of love always be with youAnd someday you'll help someone remember what I'm telling youIf I can fly I'll bet you can tooLa la da da la la la la if I can fly I'll bet you can too(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too(La la da da la la la la) if I can fly I'll bet you can too
I'm hip on happiness high on loveHooked on a feeling I can't get enough ofIt's a sweet I love you note in the pocket of my jeansSome bubble gum you left for my surpriseIt's knowing I can wake you up just to tell you I can't sleepAnd the look of love that sparkles in your eyesI'm hip on happiness high on loveHooked on a feeling that I try to be worthy ofA giving and a getting back over and aboveWhen your cup of kindness runs over with loveIt's a friend ney believing a lie somebody toldA little fella asking God to bless me tooIt's a gentle little lady who told me I touched her lifeA withered hand thanking me for what I doI'm hip on happiness...So if you can't find somebody to sing your love song toAnd if you don't like the way you're going homeChange the color of your morning by the way you look at lifeIt's too late to start all over when it's goneGet hip on happiness high on loveHooked on a feeling that you try to be worthy ofStart giving and getting back over and aboveFill your cup with kindness running over with love
I think I'll lay down on the banks of the corners of my mindSend my mem'ries and dreams for a walkWhile I listen to the sunset as it hides behind the mountainGive the clouds in the sky a chance to talkAnd make friends with a world that I daydream and love inAnd shake hands with the freedom at my feetYes I will lay me down and let me breathe the ripples of the waterFlowing from a little mountain creekAnd tell the world what I think of it and holler out I love youAnd chase a little butterfly with some little boy or girlA running barefoot on the concrete of this beautiful creationHot diggety dog hot diggety world hot diggety dog hot diggety world[ guitar + steel ]I'll pick the petals of a daisy that says everybody loves meAnd no one can do me wrong along the wayAnd I'll stretch out my arms say I'm glad that I was bornAnd make everyday a day like todayYes I'll make music with the birds and the bees in the forestAnd consider every raindrop a pearlAnd just for a while I'll set me free of myself and love this ole hot diggety worldHot diggety dog hot diggety world hot diggety dog hot diggety worldHot diggety dog hot diggety world hot diggety diggety diggety dog hot diggety world

I didn't mean to run him awayI didn't mean Lord knows it breaks his heart not for anythingI didn't mean to mess up our lives and I still can't believe I ran him awayIf you see this boy I left crying if you see this boy I left tryingTo get over one of the dumbest things I've ever doneTell him I didn't mean to hurt him like he said only I couldTell him that I still love him soIf you see this boy lookin' lonely like he's lost his one and onlyThe one I looked for so long then like a fool let him goTell him that I'm sorry and if he'll only come on back to meTell him I wouldn't ever hurt him againAnd I didn't mean to run him awayI didn't mean Lord knows to break his heart not for anythingI didn't mean to mess up our lives and I still can't believe I ran him awayThe best part of me I ran him awayIf you see this boy tell him I love him if you see this boy tell him I need himAnd if he cares at all to come on back and save my lifeTell him it would be such a shame to let our love go down the drainAnd that everyone you know makes mistakesAnd I didn't mean to run him away...I didn't mean to run him away...
You just kissed me good morning so I know you're standing thereBut can you hear the sounds before goodbye and nobody caresMaybe I'm wrong but I have the strangest feeling you're goneWhat was that you said to me my mind was out to playWith some mem'ries I saved up especially for this kind of dayGuess I'm wrong but I have the strangest feeling you're goneThere's no need to hide it we're just putting off the painAnd goodbye ain't so bad it's just a different kind of rainLike lonely dewdrops on a daisy when the evening sun goes downOr like hearing footsteps echo in an empty neon townGo on and get it over with if can't hurt me anymoreThan these transparent blindfolds that love put on beforeWish I was wrong but I have the strangest feeling you're goneGo on and built a better world I'll do what I can with mineMaybe someday we can love again at some other place or timeGoodbye darling I have the strangest feeling you're goneGoodbye darling I have the strangest feeling you're goneGoodbye hoss
When I saw you standing there I bout fell out of my chairAnd when you moved your mouth to speak I felt the blood go to my feetNow it took time for me to know what you tried so not to showSomething in my soul just cries I see the want in your blue eyesBaby I'd love you to want me the way that I want you the way that it should beBaby you'd love me to want you the way that I want to if you'd only let it be[ guitar ]You told yourself years ago you'd never let your feelings showThe obligation that you made for the title that they gaveBaby I'd love you to want me...Baby I'd love you to want me...
I'll try a little bit harder if you willAnd if you think we're worth trying to saveWe were happy once I know we were where where did we go wrongWe were on the same side one time weren't weWhy would we how could we we could not pretend for so longBut I don't want to prolong this mis'ry if you're leavin' And I don't think I'd beg you to stayBut I'll try a little bit harder if you will and if you think we're worth trying to saveWe can make it work if we care enough somehow somewhere somewayCause surely what we had is worth whatever it takes to keep itSo let's don't let it let's protect it and not let something precious get awayBut I don't want to prolong...But I'll try a little bit harder if you will and if you think we're worth trying to saveOh don't you think we're worth trying to save
I'm kickin' my heel together free again I feel like me againI know without a doubt I'm in love love loveAnd I don't have to make believe or feed a guilty conscienceLove set me free and it do feel goodI just went through this painful thing of questions without answersKept comin' back with nothin' for the longest timeMy heart kept racing with my conscience and claiming all my daydreamesWait out in front of my mindAnd that awful gnawing feeling like you're gonna die from hungerYou don't find out where you're going and how to get thereBut now it's worth all that confusion cause I found me an answerAnd I know love is alive again within meI'm kickin' my heel together...I've finally figured out how yesterdays fit into tomorrowsAnd I've learned that little doubts are just unfinished dreamsAnd I guess I'll keep on learning the same lessens all overAnd nothing is as bad as it seemsAnd I've just got to accept the fact that I have to accept the factThat love goes through changes just like we doAnd an occasional distraction a little quiet a little actionAnd a whole lot of patience will make it growI'm kickin' my heel together...I'm kickin' my heel together...I'm kickin' my heel together...
His trials now are over no more crosses to bearNo more excuses bout the way he wears his hairThey try to tell me he's free now and his mem'ry will live onWell if dying sets you free he's free but to me he's just goneCause he is no Jesus he will not rise againThree days after we lay him down cause life's all over for himThere'll be no more tomorrows no happiness and sorrows no hellos or goodbyesCause he is no Jesus just a friend of mineWe didn't always understand each other but at least we always triedWe just heard different drummers and sometimes the drummer liedWe were gonna be friends forever but forever is not a very long timeCause he is no Jesus just a friend of mineCause he is no Jesus...No mother's love no best friend's cry can wake him up to say goodbyeCause he he is no Jesus just a friend of mine
It's almost twelve o'clock but what's one more nightAmong so many nights I sit here all aloneThough I must admit by now I'm used to itAnd I'm not surprised that you're not homeSince you've grown tired of me I guess eventuallyI'll get tired too of waiting some nightBut until I do would it be too much to ask of youTo just call me and tell me you're all rightIt would only take a dime and the time it takes to callAnd all I want to know is that you're all right that's all that's allI know that it's too late we're gonna separateI'd be a fool to think we could go onAnd I know by now how I've failed you as a wife somehowAnd some of my feelings for this shell of a home are goneYes it's too late for me and you there's not much left for us to doBut I still worry about you every nightSo until we're really through is it too much to ask of youTo just call me and tell me you're all rightI'd do that much for you if you ever asked me toJust call me and tell me you're all right
It just took a little while for me to get my head togetherGrowing up's the hardest thing I've ever doneHere I am like a stranger in the house I grew up inAnd learned right from wrong in if I didWhere the sun never shined enough on daddies growing olderAnd mothers never died in but she didAnd I remember feeling guilty cause I couldn't wait to leave hereThough I loved 'em every way that I knew howSo I packed up all my yesterdays and headed for tomorrowAnd it's almost tomorrow nowAnd daddy's little girl is home but where's the little girl goneShe bundled up her dirty jeans and teenie bopper magazineIn search of what her life was all aboutWith a little rag doll named Charlie BrownAnd an ole suitcase full of hand me downsAnd a loneliness she knew so much aboutNow the dreams that I trusted and all the playthings have rustedBut here I am a woman somehowAnd all those growing pains of yesterdays are gonna get me through tomorrowCause it's almost tomorrow nowAnd daddy's little girl is home but where's the little girl goneShe bundled up her dirty jeans Oh but I can still remember when I used to gaze out this windowWondering who I was and what I would becomeAnd it just took a little while for me to get my head togetherGrowing up's the hardest thing I've ever doneOh but I can still remember
Manhattan, Kansas ain't no place to have a babyWhen you got no man to give it his last nameAnd my folks back in Manhattan didn't want me or my bundleSo I took my child and caught an evening train.And I found a job in Denver washing dishes in a dinerAt least it buys my baby milk to drinkHe once told me I was pretty but the only ring it got meWas the ring of grease that runs around the sink(Chorus)Yes, I lay beside him gentle'Cause he told me that he loved meAnd he made me dance before the music playedBut at least I didn't beg himI'd rather wash his dishes'Cause it makes me feel as if my hands are cleanAt night I stand here thinkin''Bout the man back home in KansasAnd how his folks just turned away the shameAnd I stare down through the soapsudsAnd reached down and pull the drain plugAnd I watch as Manhattan drains away(Repeat chorus)Yes it makes me feel as if my hands are clean
It's getting dark again kinda like it was beforeAnd I'm lost again somewhere out here on the roadWhere's the gold that I saw glitter and change my night to dayDon't tell me nothing is forever and nothing can stayI've felt the sun and I know the rainAnd I should know that people like the seasons will changeBut don't tell me that everything in life will be that wayDon't tell me nothing is forever and nothing can stayI guess darkness has to come whenever the sun goes downAnd death must follow birth and the cycle of life goes roundBut what of all this love I've found is it wrong to tryTo hold on to it with all I've got and want to know whyWhy can't something be for real and not change with timeAnd why can't the heart feel the same was as the mindI didn't know it long enough don't let it go awayDon't tell me nothing is forever and nothing can stayOh don't let love and happiness turn out that wayDon't tell me nothing is forever and nothing can stay
Puffy eyes aching head echoes of the words I saidKeep following me around from room to roomThough I've climbed these stairs before and knocked on this same doorHow much longer will you let me inI didn't mean all the things I said but a heart full of regretsAnd all the tears these puffy eyes can cry for youWill do everything we know to do to try to make it up to youIf you'll just forgive us once againI would get what was comin' to me if you ever left me honeyYou'd better be off without me no doubt about itBut I hope you'll stay and love meAnd try to understand my crazy way of lovin' you[ steel ]Can't you tell these puffy eyes love youI think that devil must've had a hand in makin' me like I amBut I hope I'm worth the time it takes to changeCause as mean to you as I seem to be there's a love as deep as love can beIf I could only make you understandI would get what was comin' to me...I would get what was comin' to me...
Sing a la la de de and a la la de doI just made up this rotten little song for me and youToday I wrote a rotten melody and the words are just as bad as you can seeBut if you want to sing along with this rotten little songYou're as welcome as the flowers in the springJust sing a la la for you and a de de for meAnd you put 'em both together get a la la deSing a la la de de and add a little doAnd we'll both sing this rotten little song for me and youAll in all it has been a rotten day and I wouldn't have it any other wayAnd I won't try to analyze all the if's and but's and why'sCause I know that it will soon go awayJust sing a la la for you...Sing a la la for you...Sing a la la for you...Sing a la la for you...

I take out my guitar and strum all my dreamsIt's somewhere around here I knowDon't let me chase rainbows that don't would have an endThere must be a song I can singWhere is the melody and where are the words where is the rhythm of the drumAnd where are the voices that can make my heart bringI know there's a song I can singAnd if I keep trying find a secret to wake me from my dreamThat sleeps on the footsteps of my soulSome day I'll hear the music that can bring my voice swingsCause I know there's a song I can singYes some day I'll hear the melody and I'll find the wordsAnd I'll feel the rhythm of the drumAnd I'll listen to the voices that can make my heart bringYes somewhere there's a song I can singYes some day I'll hear the melody...

(One two one two three four)You don't tug on Superman's cape you don't spit into the windYou don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger and you don't mess around with Jim Well uptown got it's hustlers the Bowery got it's bumsAnd forty second street got big Jim Walker he's a pool shootin' son of a gunYeah he's big and dumb as a man can comeBut he's stronger than a country hossAnd when the bad folks all get together at nightYou know they all call big Jim boss just becauseAnd they say you don't tug on Superman's cape you don't spit into the windYou don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger and you don't mess around with Jim Well outta south Alabama come a country boyHe said I'm lookin' for a man named JimWell I'm a pool shootin' boy my name is Willie McCoyBut down home they call me SlimYeah I'm looking for the king of Forty Second Street he drivin' a drop top CadillacLast week he took all my money and it may sound funnyBut I come to get my money backAnd everybody say Jack don't you know you don't on Superman's capeYou don't spit into the windYou don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger and you don't mess around with Jim Well a hush fell over the pool room Jimmy come boppin' in off of the streetAnd when the cuttin' were done the only part that wasn't bloody Was the soles of the big man's feetYeah he were cut in bout a hundred places and he were shot in a couple moreAnd you better believe they sung a different kind of story when big Jim hit the floorNow they say you don't tug on Superman's cape you don't spit into the windYou don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger and you don't mess around with SlimNo no no you don't tug on Superman's cape...No no no you don't tug on Superman's cape...
Can't remember my first mem'ry of you you were always thereAnd now I know I never knew you wellBut I was just a kid and you were always there to pick me up everytime I fellAnd you always warmed a blanket to wrap around my feetWhen you tucked me into bed to say my prayersAnd I'll bet I never thanked you among all the other thingsThat I took for granted cause you were always thereYes you were always there so we never took the timeFor you to tell me your dreams and me to tell you mineAnd we never took the time to talk of love and happinessAnd life and death and heartache and pain and lonelinessWhy I don't even know if you were happy or if you could have beenOr if you could have one wish what would it beOr what would you do differently if you could live againAnd were you glad that you gave life to meAnd I'd give anything to tell you am I glad that you were bornBut you'll never hear the words I've learned to sayCause before I got to know you died of lonelinessAnd they tell me I grew up and moved awayYes you were always there so we never took the timeFor you to tell me your dreams and me to tell you mineThere were so many things that could have been but now we'll never shareCause kids don't know much and you were always thereNo kids don't know much and you were always there
If I was yours and you were mine I'd spank your bottom every timeYou drink too much and smoke too much or talk too much look who's talkingSometimes I think how it would be if I loved you and you loved meWhat we'd do differently than what we're doing now but I'm just talkingCause you're not Charlie Brown and I'm not Raggedy AnnAnd this ain't a little cigar band I'm wearing on my handWe're not playing spin the battle in a world of make believeLike the heros in a storybook that we can't wait to readBut I wonder if there's be any harm for you to hold me in your armsAnd steal a kiss or two then I could forget about youListen to me talking no I'm not yours and you're not mineAnd kissing on you'd be out of lineAnd the kind of hearts we have are the kind that break in twoOver people like me and youCause you're not Charlie Brown...No you're not Charlie Brown...
