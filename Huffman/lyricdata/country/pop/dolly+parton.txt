(Dolly Parton)There's a bit of magic in a simple little smile Something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile And there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand A gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand Oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give We could make the world we're living in a better place to live La la la la la la la la la la la la And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me La la la la la la la la la la la la All life has to offer that's what most folks desire But offer nothing in return, cause they don't seem to care And if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive We could make the world we're living in a better place to live And if we'd all climb together, we could climb the highest hill We could make the world we're living in a better place to live And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me La la la la la la la la la la la la 
You've made this a Christmas to remember Springtime feelin's in the middle of December Strangers meet and they willingly surrender Oh! What a Christmas to remember Almost went to Aspen but something told me no I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and You've made this a Christmas to remember Springtime feelin's in the middle of December Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer Oh! What a Christmas to remember Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave Christmas to remember, too good to believe Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind And you've made this a Christmas to remember Springtime feelin's in the middle of December Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender Oh! What a Christmas to remember We loved and laughed and played and joked Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes Then to the lodge for dinner But now it's time for us to go As our hearts melt like chimney snow There's just one thing I want to know Can we do this next winter Oh! What a Christmas to remember You've made this a Christmas to remember Springtime feelin's in the middle of December Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer Oh! What a Christmas to remember You've made this a Christmas to remember Springtime feelin's in the middle of December Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers Oh! What a Christmas to remember
(Dolly Parton)Sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do He'll lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose What is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool She swears she never knew but always needed to But stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys I suppose Even love can't change the things he ought to change the most And it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees Makin' apologies but she loves him desperately Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet So he'd know all the perfect lines to say And have some great romantic way to show it Be the hero ridin' up to save the day And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor To sweep her up and carry her away Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways "I love you" and "I'm sorry" are words that just don't come Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue But his eyes keep tellin' her "you know I love you anyway No matter what I say or what I never say" Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet So he'd know all those fancy lines to say And have some great romantic way to show it Be the hero ridin' up to save the day And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor And sweep her up and carry her away Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways His ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer But even love can't change a cowboy's ways He's just a fool that must defend his honor But even love can't change a cowboy's ways
Just a few old memories Slipped in through my door Though I thought I had closed it So tightly before I can't understand it Why it should bother my mind For it all belongs to another place and time Just a few old keep-sakes Way back on the shelf No, they don't mean nothin' Well I'm surprised they're still left Just a few old love letters With the edges all brown And an old faded picture I keep turned upside-down Just a few old memories Going way back in time Well I can hardly remember I don't know why I'm cryin' I can't understand it Well I'm surprised myself First thing tomorrow morning I'll clean off that shelf Just a few old keep-sakes Way back on the shelf No, they don't mean nothin' Well I'm surprised that they're left Just a few old love letters With their edges all brown And an old faded picture I keep turned upside-down

The cold December wind seems bent on rockin' New York City The town that's got me down to my last dime And everywhere I go, the people seem in such a hurry To keep this Mobile girl from feelin' fine [Chorus]Lord, what I'd give to see an Alabama sundown The sun just seemed to drop in Mobile Bay New York town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down But that never was the Mobile way, no, no That never was the Mobile way A flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar In anybody's town, that price is cheap It's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards Cause I need ninety cents to go to sleep [Chorus]I felt so big the day I left that Mobile couldn't hold me I thought there had to be a better way But if I could find that man that first called Lady Luck a lady That gentleman would surely learn to pray [Chorus: x2]

I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,Like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe thatI'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep.I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam.I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.And I'm all dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,And even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt.I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.Yes, I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance,But even backwoods Barbie's deserve a second chance.I'm just a backwoods Barbie just asking for a chance,Just a backwoods Barbie.

(Dolly Parton)Last night you called me Barbara As you lay fast asleep And although I'm not Barbara You wanted me to be You whispered words I haven't heard In such a long, long time Last night you said I love you With Barbara on your mind Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin And strands of chestnut hair That say you've been with her again Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find Last night you called me darlin' With Barbara on your mind With Barbara on your mind You held me in your arms so tight And lying there so close to you I cried until day light And though you think that I don't know I'm really not that blind Last night you said I love you With Barbara on your mind Last night you called me darlin' With Barbara on your mind
Everytime the bluebird singsMy heart takes wings to the skyThe bluebird greyside flyTo my place in your eyesCause after all, I did all I couldAnd you did your best, just the sameNobody won, we both lost, no one's to blameBut I'll fly away to you, if only pretendingWe'll be like bluebird do, the beautiful lieThe beautiful lie, the beautiful lieEverytime the bluebird singsMy heart takes wings to the skyThe bluebird greyside flyTo my place in your eyesCause after all, I did all I couldAnd you did your best, just the sameNobody won, we both lost, no one's to blameBut I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretendingAnd we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lieWe'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleepAnd wonder who I was before I loved youLying here beside you feeling so completeThinking how I love and need and trust youBecause I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love meI can face the world and have the cause I love youBecause you love me because I love you Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying thereAnd let you soon awake and reach to hold meAnd anyway you want me that's the way that I am yoursLove as strong as this lets you control meBecause I love you...Because I love you...
I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time But that was before I met you I never saw one that I wanted for mine But that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved But that was before I met you I thought I'd stay single always be free But that was before I met you I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me But that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved But that was before I met you That was before I met you
What are we doing in this place alone is our desire to relive our past this strongTrue love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers onLet's go home before our weakness gets too strongLong ago we let the flame of love burn out of controlNow we have no reason to reach for love that has grown coldIf we live our past in the present our future will be goneLet's go home before our weakness gets too strong[ fiddle ]Line with temptation we raced into the pastOn a road too small to let the past and the present passAre we going too fast to turn back and leave the past aloneLet's go home before our weakness gets too strongLong ago we let the flame...Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

My baby makes me proudLord, don't he make me proud He never makes a scene Hangin' all over me in a crowd 'Cause people like to talk Lord, don't they love to talk But when they turn out the lights I know he'll be leavin' with me And when we get behind closed doors Then we let out hair hang down Then he makes me glad that he's my man And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors My baby makes me smile Lord, don't he make me smile I'm never far away Or too tired to say I want to I'm purring like a kitten When he's out in public with me But when they turn out the lights He brings out the tiger in me And when we get behind closed doors Then we let out hair hang down Then he makes me glad that he's my man And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors Behind closed doors

We're all together once againFor the first time in I don't know whenWe were so close once upon a timeThere were five of us kids at homeTwo girls, three boys and Dad and MomBut that was in the better partOf life we left behindRemember that old swimming holeWhere we would swim so long agoAnd all them possum grapes and muskedinesAnd do you recall the timeWe all got drunk on homemade wineThat was in the better partOf life we left behind Life was simple for us thenIf only it could be againHow I wish we could go back in timeBut time moves on and nothin' lastsExcept the memories from the pastMemories from the better partOf life we left behind Remember how we talked as kidsOf what we'd be when we got bigAnd all the dreams that we held in our mindsI wanted to be a singin' starAnd you all said that I'd go farBut that was in the better partOf life we left behind Remember all the fun we hadBack when they say times were badAnd life was good to us and things were fineWe had fun and we had loveAnd a mom and dad to care for usBut that was is the better partOf life we left behind Life was simple for us thenIf only it could be againHow I wish we could go back in timeBut time moves on and nothin' lastsExcept the memories from the pastMemories from the better partOf life we left behindSweet memories from the better partOf life we left behind

(Dolly Parton)In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day And I considered myself as lucky When he told me he would take me away And though he was older, it made me no difference His promise of riches was all I could see At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky And know something better than sad poverty Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you But there are other places in the world I'd like to see So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin' But I'll always hold you in my memory But I've never adjusted to sociable livin' The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky In a mansion with a husband that never loved me He won't let my family and friends come to visit Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them All that's changed about me is my name Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it It's my last request and he can't refuse me I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky Where my family and my friends can come and visit me Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you But different from the way you remember me before So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore I'll sleep in your arms forever more

She was born in a place called Blue ValleyAt the foot of the Tennessee hillsWith the blue birds and blue bellsAnd blue mountain waterAnd the sound of the Blue WhippoorwillBut there was no peace in the valleyHer daddy, a cruel, ruthless manUsed and abused her mind and her bodySo her mama said run while you canSo at fifteen she took to the highwayBelongings and guitar in handAnd she buried herself in her musicThe one thing she did understand And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poetHer voice has that high, lonesome soundShe hurts, and her songs are the best way to show itSo the Blue Valley songbird keeps traveling around She hopes someday she will make itAnd everyone says that she willWhen she comes to town, crowds flock aroundTo see the girl from the Tennessee hillsShe writes her letter back home to her mamaIn care of the preacher in townThey're sacred to her so she reads them at churchAnd so her daddy cannot track her down And she sings like a bird and she cries like a babyWhenever she turns off the lightsShe's a whole lot lonesome and a little bit crazyFrom mem'ries and miseries and dreams gone awry Blue dress, blue shoes, a blue CadillacA band dressed in blue by her sideInstruments tied to the top and the back'Cause the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight One nighters, honky tonks, years flying byShe never made it, but Lord knows she triesExpressing the feelings she holds insideAnd the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonightOh the Blue Valley songbird is singing tonight And she sings like a bird and she writes like a poet
(Dolly Parton)I was lookin' for greener pastures When I left my old Kentucky home I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master So I left the one that loved me all along Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better Didn't care about the grief I left behind Didn't even make a card or write a letter So sure I'd be successful in no time Now I'm heading for bluer pastures And back to the one who's heart I broke To the bluegrass state of Kentucky Where he waits with open for me I hope Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger? How what you have is never good enough How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder Lookin' for the treasures you gave up Well the seasons came, they went The dreams all shattered While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound Now I'm heading for bluer pastures And back to the one who's heart I broke To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky Where he waits with open for me I hope Now I'm heading for bluer pastures Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind Where the bluegrass music's always playin' To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin I'm heading for bluer pastures 
(Dolly Parton)Bobby's arms, they are warm when he holds me Bobby's arms always comfort and console me When I'm in his arms held tight I know everything's alright Just as long as I'm inside bobby's arms Chorus: Bobby's arms always welcome me inside Bobby's arms always hold me when I cry Bobby's arms are my shelter from life's storms And I feel so safe in Bobby's arms Bobby's arms, they are strong but they're tender Bobby's arms reach for me and I surrender When he reaches out for me, I'm never out of reach And I always want to be in Bobby's arms Repeat Chorus

(feat. Judy Collins and Rhonda Vincent) Rows and floes of angel hairAnd ice cream castles in the airAnd feather canyons ev'rywhereI've looked at clouds that way But now they only block the sunThey rain and snow on ev'ryoneSo many things I would have doneBut clouds got in my wayI've looked at clouds from both sides nowFrom up and down, and still somehowIt's cloud illusions I recallI really don't know clouds at all Moons and Junes and Ferris wheelsThe dizzy dancing way you feelAs ev'ry fairy tale comes realI've looked at love that way But now it's just another showYou leave 'em laughing when you goAnd if you care, don't let them knowDon't give yourself away I've looked at love from both sides nowFrom give and take, and still somehowIt's love's illusions I recallI really don't know love at all Tears and fears and feeling proudTo say "I love you" right out loudDreams and schemes and circus crowdsI've looked at life that way But now old friends are acting strangeThey shake their heads, they say I've changedWell something's lost, but something's gainedIn living ev'ry day I've looked at life from both sides nowFrom win and lose and still somehowIt's life's illusions I recallI really don't know life at allI've looked at life from both sides nowFrom up and down, and still somehowIt's life's illusions I recallI really don't know life at all
I don't want to hear a love song I got on this airplane just to fly I know there's life below me And all that you can show me is the prairie and the sky I don't want to hear a sad story filled with heartbreak and desire The last time I felt like this I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire And I stood on the mountain in the night And I watched it burn, I watched it burn, I watched it burn I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham I would hold my life in a saving grace I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham If I thought I could see, see your face Well you really got me this time And the hardest part is knowing I survive And I've come to listen to the sounds of trucks As they moved out on Highway 95 And pretending it's the ocean coming to wash me clear To wash me clear if you know what I mean I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham I would hold my life in a saving grace I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham If I thought I could see, see your face

You're the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes You're the one that puts the laughter in my smile You're the one that puts the meaning in my life And I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over Because you are mine Bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring Bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see That I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over Because you love me I have never known a love that felt like this You're the one I want to share my lovin' with Your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness Keeps me bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over with happiness Bubblin' over with the joy that only love can bring Bubblin' over with the song you taught my heart to sing And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone could see That I'm bubblin' over, bubblin' over, bubblin' over Because you love me Yes, I'm bubblin' over, I'm bubblin' over, I'm bubblin' over 'Cause you love me 
(Dolly Parton)When I look at you I melt like a candle You light a fire in me What am I to do I just hope I can handle The heat and the smoke blinding me This feeling, this fire This burning desire Is raging its way through my soul And if you feel the same Help me fan the flames 'Til we're burning out of control Burning to know you Burning to show you And I've felt this way from the start Burning with passion I do hope it's lasting And it's burning a hole in my heart You kindle in me A warm glowing feeling A spark and a flicker of hope It's more than a game And like moths to a flame We're drawn to its warmth and its glow These embers of love Are fueled by the notion This could be an eternal flame Consumed by the blaze I fear it's too late 'Cause this torch that I hold bears your name Oh, and I'm burning to know you Burning to hold you It's grown to a flame from a spark Burning with passion I do hope it's lasting And it's burning a hole in my heart Oh, I'm burning with passion I do hope it's lasting... I've had so many dreams fall apart... And it's burning a hole in my heart... I'm burning Oh, I'm burning Mmmm, I'm burning oh, I burning ooh
(Dolly Parton/Bill Owens)You lied to me I can't believe That I've been such a fool I thought this time I might find Someone who would play by the rules My mind said no But my heart said go And again I've made the wrong turn Now here I stand My heart in your hands... And I've gone from burning to burned Ah, you'd think by now I'd know how To keep this heart of mine safe It goes to show You just never know Who can you trust these days How could I make The same mistake But as far as I'm concerned Got myself to blame Got to close to the flame Now I've gone from burning to burned Everyone knows The old saying goes That a fool in love Never learns But I guess I forgot 'Cause the fire was too hot...

When the mornin' sun Streaks across my room And I'm wakin' up From another dream of you Yes, you know I'm on the road Once again it seems All that's left behind Is a chain of broken dreams But you know that I love you You know that I love you Oh, I love you And how I wish that love Was all we'd need to live What a life we'd have 'Cause I've got so much to give But ya' know I feel so sad Down inside my heart That the dollar sign Should be keepin' us apart But you know that I love you You know that I love you Oh, how I love you And if only I could find my way back to the time When the problems of this life Had not yet crossed my mind And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes I'd come runnin' back to you I'd come runnin' back to you But you know we can't Live on dreams alone Got to pay the rent So I must leave you all alone 'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago And now this travelin' life Well, it's the only life I know But you know that I love you You know that I love you Oh, I love you But you know that I love you You know that I love you Oh, how I love you But you know that I love you You know that I love you Oh, how I love you But you know I love you But you know I love you Oh, I love you But you know that I love you But you know that I love you Oh, how I love you But you know that I love you But you know that I love you Oh, how I love you
Remember all the castles that we once built in the sandRemember how we used to go and visit fairy landRemember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's endBut you loved me thenAnd the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did runAnd the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sunAnd the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the windBut you loved me thenNow I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sandWhen you left I lost my way forever and the fairy landNow the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all diedAnd the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free againAnd the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the windAnd you no longer care but you love me then(And you no longer care) but you love me then(And you no longer care) but you love me then
(Dolly Parton)I would spin for you a blanket Out of gold and silver threads I would let my gentle bosom Be a pillow for your head I'd caress your perfect body On a rosy bed at night Play you love songs on a golden harp And sing you Butterflies In a diamond-studded chalice On an emerald-plated tray I would bring to you sweet nectar And gifts of bright array I would paint for you a castle In a blue and yellow sky Paint you happy ever after And paint you Butterflies Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion I get high on the wings of sweet emotion Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies I get close to you and I get butterflies If only I were magic I would make the wishes true I would wave a magic wand And be in Paradise with you But I'm just a girl that loves you I will love you all my life But I do have a magic feeling And it gives me butterflies Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion I get high on the wings of sweet emotion Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies We should fly away together, you and I Off to paradise forever, I get high I get close to you and I get butterflies I think of you and I get butterflies I will spin for you a blanket out of gold and silver threads If only I were magic, I would make the wishes true I would wave a magic wand and be in paradise with you 
(Dolly Parton)In a dream I was walkin' in a beautiful field I was gathering flowers at the foot of a hill When a bright light descended and it spread o'er the land Jesus stood on the mountain and He held out His hand Then He came down from the mountain, headed down to the sea And the children strowed flowers in the path at His feet And He was filled with compassion and the beasts from the wild Came as gentle as lambs and they all walked at His side There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love Ain't that a wonderful feelin', let us lift Him up Then He suddenly vanished from the crowd down below Reappeared on the mountain in a radiant glow He said your questions are many but the answer is love I'll draw all men unto me if I be lifted up There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about There's a light in the darkness, there's joy in His love There is life everlasting, let us lift Him up He said if I Be lifted up He said if I be lifted up, what did he say He said if I Be lifted up He said if I be lifetd up Let's lift Him higher and higher And higher and higher each day Let's lift Him up He said if I Be lifted up Oh if I be lifted up There's a calm on the water, a hush in the crowd There's peace in the valley, there's a stillness about There's a light in the darkness, and joy in His love It's a wonderful feelin', lift Him up He said if I Be lifted up He said if I be lifted up, that's what he said He said if I Be lifted up If I be lifted up

Back through the yearsI go wonderin' once againBack to the seasons of my youthI recall a box of rags that someone gave usAnd how my momma put the rags to useThere were rags of many colorsEvery piece was smallAnd I didn't have a coatAnd it was way down in the fogMomma sewed the rags togetherSewin' every piece with loveShe made my coat of many colorsThat I was so proud ofAs she sewed, she told a storyFrom the bible, she had readAbout a coat of many colorsJoseph wore and then she saidPerhaps this coat will bring youGood luck and happinessAnd I just couldn't wait to wear itAnd momma blessed it with a kissMy coat of many colorsThat my momma made for meMade only from ragsBut I wore it so proudlyAlthough we had no moneyI was rich as I could beIn my coat of many colorsMy momma made for meSo with patches on my britchesHoles in both my shoesIn my coat of many colorsI hurried off to schoolJust to find the others laughingAnd making fun of meIn my coat of many colorsMy momma made for meAnd oh I couldn't understand itFor I felt I was richAnd I told them of the loveMy momma sewed in every stitchAnd I told 'em all the storyMomma told me while she sewedAnd how my coat of many colorsWas worth more than all their clothesBut they didn't understand itAnd I tried to make them seeThat one is only poorOnly if they choose to beNow I know we had no moneyBut I was rich as I could beIn my coat of many colorsMy momma made for meMade just for me

What's that you say, you can't stay? You seem to come and go At times my mind is crystal clear And then I think of you Then the spin of the room I'm in Brings you into view Love that once Held my mind completely in control Now makes it spin like tornado winds As it comes and goes

(Dolly Parton/Dorothy Jo Hope)In this mental institution, lookin' out through these iron bars How could he put me in here, how could he go that far Yes I need help but not this kind, he didn't love me from the start But it's not my mind that's broken, it's my heart Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you I'm depending on you Daddy, there's nothing I can do And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me When he said he loved another, I was crazy with jealousy That's 'cause I was crazy over him and I couldn't stand to set him free And I couldn't stand to lose him and I cried and cried for days And he said that I was crazy but he just put me in here to get me out of his way Daddy come and get me Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you I'm depending on you Daddy 'cause there's nothing else I can do And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me Oh Daddy, come and get me 
(Dolly Parton)Daddy was an old time preacher man He preacher the word of God throughout the land He preached so plain a child could understand Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man He told the people of he need to pray He talked about God's wrath and judgement day He preached about the great eternity He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Aunt Leanona would get up to testify And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By" The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land" Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks Folks came from all around to hear him preach Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all But the aisles were always filled at altar calls Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay For he believed that God provides a way We never had a lot but we got by Guess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man 
As I look around the little house we were so happy inI think of all the happy times we'll never see againThen I break down and start to cry, the children ask what forI can't find a way to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymoreEach night before they go to sleep they fold their little handsAnd say a prayer for Daddy fighting in their far-off landSo tonight I'll help them say their prayers like I've always done beforeGod give me courage to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore But honey as for me there'll never be another manAnd I'll bring our children up the best way that I canYou died for what you thought was right that much I know for sureBut the children just can't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore No the children just don't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore
Folks say my daddy wasn't much of a man For disobeying the laws of the land Folks say that my daddy wasn't fit to kill Oh and I know it was true what the people said Cause we'd all've been better of dead Than to live a life of shame and strife Cause of daddy's moonshine still My mama was always sweet and kind But she grew old before her time Worryin' about the way we had to live Yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mama's face He drunk his share of all he made And just one more reason I grew to hate My daddy's moonshine still Chorus: Daddy's moonshine still was good for nothin' But to break mama's heart And to tear our home apart Make our lives a livin' hell Them old mason jars that daddy made us wash And set them out to sun on our back porch 'Til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill And when daddy got word of the revenue He made us kids help hide his brew Made us swear that we never knew About daddy's moonshine still Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line Once a week with a load of moonshine And the wounds that came from that won't ever heal Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night My two brothers lost their lives And oh my god how I despise My daddy's moonshine still Repeat Chorus Well it broke mama's heart but she understood The day that I left home for good But I had to find me another way to live Well I sent mama money nearly every day And how I made it, well I'd rather not say But at least it took me far away From daddy's moonshine still My bootlegging daddy was known quite well And he made our home a livin' hell And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will My mama finally died she just gave up And daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff And bad memories haunt the rest of us From daddy's moonshine still Repeat Chorus
(Dolly Parton)My dear hard workin' daddy works his life away for us That's the way that daddy shows to us his love And Daddy's two hard working hands They're callous and they're sore And Daddy's workin' boots have walked a million miles or more As long as I remember, I remember Daddy workin' Workin' on the job or either on the farm Tryin' to provide for the family that he loves And Daddy's working boots have taken many steps for us Chorus: Daddy's workin' boots have served as his foundation Though just like him, they're tired and worn For years they've helped him stand Daddy's working boots have filled their obligation They've walked that rocky road with a mighty, mighty man Dear lord above, I know up there my Daddy's got a mansion And a great reward that's long been overdue And when it comes my Daddy's time to be with you in heaven Spoken: Won't cha let him walk your golden streets In a pair of brand new golden boots Repeat Chorus Daddy's workin' boots 
(Dolly Parton)Oh, you're out there tonight with another And my pain is so dreadfully sharp. I picture you with her and shudder, It's like a dagger through the heart Do you think that my feelings don't matter, Or your cheatin' or hurtful remarks When you leave me all broken and shattered It's like a dagger through the heart Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin' When you've made hurtin' me such an art, Tossed around like a used box of crayons, It's like a dagger through the heart Oh, you cut me to pieces so often Like a knife or a poisonous dart I would be better off in my coffin, It's like a dagger through the heart Oh, I know I'm a fool to keep stayin' When you've made hurtin' me such an art, Tossed around like a used box of crayons, It's like a dagger through the heart Like a dagger through the heart, through the heart 
(Merle Travis)Come and listen you fellows So young and do fine And seek not your fortune In the dark, dreary mines It will form as a habit Seep in your soul 'Til the blood in your veins Runs as black as the coal There's many a man That I've known in my day Who lived just to labor His whole life away Like a fiend with his dope And a drunkard his wine A man will have lust for The lure of the mine It's dark as a dungeon Damp as the dew The danger is double And the pleasures are few Where the rain never falls Where the sun never shines It's dark as a dungeon Way down in the mine I hope when I'm gone And the ages shall roll My body will blacken And turn into coal Then I'll look out the door Of my heavenly home And I'll pity the miners A-diggin' my bones It's dark as a dungeon Damp as the dew The danger is double And the pleasures are few Where the rain never falls Where the sun never shines It's dark as a dungeon Way down in the mine Where the rain never falls Where the sun never shines It's dark as a dungeon Way down in the mine

Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walkedLong ago in the sweet used to beAnd the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweetAs they did when you picked them for meChorus:And when I think of you and the love we once knewHow I wish we could go back in timeDo you ever think back on old memories like thatOr do I ever cross your mindDo you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the nightBecause you miss me, do you darlingOh, and do your memories ever takeYou back into another place in timeAnd do you ever miss the feelingsAnd the love we shared when you were with me, tell me darlingOr do I ever cross your mindOh, how often I wish that again I could kissYour sweet lips like I did long agoAnd how often I long for those two loving armsThat once held me so gentle and closeRepeat chorus
Where you live you say the view is so beautifulAnd the astroturf that's on your lawn stays green the whole year aroundAnd the buildings are so tall they almost reach heavenBut do you ever ever hear the robins singDo you hear the robins singing in the springtimeWhile a mockingbird sings his happy songIs all the beauty in your world this artificial thingDo you ever ever hear the robins sing[ ac.guitar ]Where I live the butterflies still kiss the rosesAnd forgetmenots still grow along the shady laneAnd the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breezeAnd often I still hear the robins singDo you hear the robins...Do you ever ever hear the robins sing
You left you didn't say goodbyeYou never gave me a reason whyMy tears are dried now it's been a whileNow there you szand you're back againDo you think that time stands still do you think that time stands stillThings have changed I've rearranged so many thingsDo you think that time stands still do you think that time stands stillIt never has it never will do you think that time stands stillYou won't to start where we left offSomebody found the love you lostLove has its price we've paid the costWe lose and learn now it's your turnDo you think that time stands still...Do you think that time stands still...Oh do you think that time stands still...

(Dolly Parton)Our love affair is bitter sweet Insecure and incomplete And I've often wondered why your leaving's been so long delayed It's all become so complicated Maybe you feel obligated And out of simpathy for me you stay But I had rather live alone Than live with someone who doesn't love me And I'd rather have you go than stay And put me down a thinkin' you're above me Our love affair is so wound up It's best that we unwind And if you don't love me, leave me And don't let it trouble your mind You've waited much too long to leave afraid of how I'd take it And I'm deeply touched by your concern but I think I can make it It won't be easy for a while but I'll forget in time And if you don't love me, leave me and don't let it trouble your mind I had rather live alone Than live with someone who doesn't love me And I'd rather have you go than stay And put me down a-thinkin' you're above me Our love affair is so wound up It's best that we unwind And if you don't love me, leave me And don't let it trouble your mind 
I'm tempted, my darlin' to steal you awayDon't let me cross over, stay out of my way'Cause you know that I love you and I'm not the stealin' kindBut I'm faced with heartache here at love's cheating lineDon't let me cross over love's cheating lineYou belong to another and can never be mineI know one step closer would be heaven divineDon't let me cross over love's cheating lineI've tried to forget you but what else can I doWhen your eyes keep saying that you want me tooAnd I know if I lose you not a dream will I have leftI don't want to cheat, dear but I can't help myselfDon't let me cross over love's cheating lineYou belong to another and can never be mineI know one step closer would be heaven divineDon't let me cross over love's cheating lineDon't let me cross over love's cheating line
(Dolly Parton)Spent all my money on everyone else Why I just kept handing it out right and left They didn't appreciate none of my help I have found Had me a man I was so much in love But he just walked off after using me up I cried like a baby It hurt me so much and I'm down Yeah, I'm sure down I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up I just need some time Just need a little streak of good luck And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am You try to do right but tell me where does that get you People just use you and then they forget you Well it won't take me long To get my feet back on solid ground But now I'm down When I get my life back in order again Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around I'll be spending my money on everyone else Well I'll just be handing it out right and left I'll find a new love I won't live by myself I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up I just need some time Just need a little streak of good luck And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am You try to do right but tell me where does that get you People just use you and then they forget you Well it won't take me long To get my feet back on solid ground But now I'm down I know that I'm down But I'm bound to get up 
(Dolly Parton)I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of clover And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home place My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down from Dover I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no crying I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold her So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover Down from Dover 
(Dolly Parton)Down on Music Row Down on music Row If you want to be a star That's where you've got to go I could feel a change a comin' I left my hometown a hummin' With my ol' guitar a strummin' Songs that I had wrote I was on my way to Nashville I just couldn't hardly wait 'Till I could sing my songs To the folks on Music Row I got into Nashville early Sleepy, hungry, tired and dirty And on the steps of RCA I ate a stale, sweet roll In the fountain at the hall of fame I washed my face and read the names In the walkway of the stars Down on Music Row Down on Music Row Down on music Row If you want to be a star That's where you've got to go I waited there 'till eight o'clock When office doors became unlocked Then I started walkin' Down the streets of Music Row Just a walkin' up and down the street Tryin' to find out who to see To help me get on record And to hear the songs I'd wrote But I found it goin' rough Everyone was all tied up Either in a conference Or in the studio They said that I could leave a tape But they'd suggest I didn't wait 'Cause everyone was awful busy Down on Music Row But I could feel that change a comin' And I just kept right on a hummin' With my ol' guitar still strummin' All them songs that I'd wrote And then Chet and Bob at RCA Well, they listened to my songs that day And they both told me that I was on my way Down on Music Row Down on Music Row Down on music Row If you want to be a star That's where you've got to go 
When you're alone and life is making you lonely You can always go downtown When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry Seems to help, I know, downtown Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty How can you lose? The lights are much brighter there You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares And go downtown Things'll be great when you're downtown No finer place for sure, downtown Everything's waiting for you Don't hang around and let your problems surround you There are movie shows, downtown Or maybe you know some little places to go to Where they never close, downtown Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin' Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin' Happy again The lights are much brighter there You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares And go downtown Where all the lights are bright, downtown Waiting for you tonight, downtown You're gonna be alright now And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along So maybe I'll see you there You can forget all your troubles Just forget all your cares And go downtown Things'll be great when you're downtown Don't wait a minute more, downtown Everything's waiting for you Downtown, where all the lights are bright Downtown, waiting for you tonight Downtown, you're going to be alright now Get on, get on, get on downtown Downtown, where all the lights are bright Downtown, waiting for you tonight Downtown, you're going to be alright now Get on, get on, get on downtown

(Dolly Parton)She's been there, God knows, she's been there She has seen and done it all She's a woman, she know how to Dish it out or take it all Her heart's as soft as feathers Still she weathers stormy skies And she's a sparrow when she's broken But she's an eagle when she flies A kaleidoscope of colors You can toss her around and round You can keep her in you vision But you'll never keep her down She's a lover, she's a mother She's a friend and she's a wife And she's a sparrow when she's broken But she's an eagle when she flies Gentle as the sweet magnolia Strong as steel, her faith and pride She's an everlasting shoulder She's the leaning post of life She hurts deep and when she weeps She's just as fragile as a child And she's a sparrow when she's broken But she's an eagle when she flies She's a sparrow when she's broken But she's an eagle when she flies Oh, bless her, Lord She's an eagle when she flies
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun Closing it behind me and away I do run To the meadow where the meadow larkIs singing in the tree In the meadow I go walkingIn the early morning breezeI cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums Drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves In the meadow where I'm walkingIn the early morning breeze Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees To have a word with God in the early morning breeze A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums Drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves In the meadow where I'm walkingIn the early morning breeze
You might wake up some morningTo the sound of something moving past your window in the windAnd if you're quick enough to riseYou'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadowOut on the new horizonYou may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wingsAnd if the sleep has left your earsYou might hear footsteps running through an open meadow Don't be concerned, it will not harm youIt's only me pursuing something I'm not sure ofAcross my dreams, with nets of wonderI chase the bright elusive butterfly of love You might have heard my footstepsEcho softly in the distance through the canyons of your mindI might have even called your nameAs I ran searching after something to believe inYou might have seen me runnin'Through the long abandonned ruins of the dreams you left behindIf you remember something thereThat glided past you followed close by heavy breathing Don't be concerned, it will not harm youIt's only me pursuing something I'm not sure ofAcross my dreams, with nets of wonderI chase the bright elusive butterfly of love Across my dreams, with nets of wonderI chase the bright elusive butterfly of loveAcross my dreams, with nets of wonderI chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
(Dolly Parton)I cry awake at night and hug my pillow And pray that I will die before I wake No such luck Another day of cryin' Don't know how much more my old heart can break Flooded with these memories and emotions The tears like rain keep on falling down They say that I'll forget But my face is just as wet As it was the day you left this town Drowning in this endless, endless Drowning in an endless stream of tears It's relentless and I'm defenseless Drowning in an endless stream of tears I can't believe that I can talk about it I never thought I'd live to see this day But a broken heart won't kill you You just want to die But you have to go on livin' anyway I feel it through and through And I've never been so blue And I cried a river over you Drowning in this endless, endless Drowning in an endless stream of tears It's relentless and I'm defenseless Drowning in an endless stream of tears Oh, I'm drowning in this endless, endless Drowning in this endless, endless Drowning in this endless, endless Drowning in this endless stream of tears
It's funny how love goes 'Cause I know this could never work out But honey, how love grows Even though there's no reason to doubt This can never be You keep saying it's wrong Neither one of us is free Still I want to hold on When even a fool would let go 'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying Even a child would say no When he knows that he'll end up crying Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you Even a fool would let go Love has no reason Like the words in a song that don't rhyme My love has no season I just know that it's there all the time Maybe just you and me I can't believe that it's wrong Thinking about you and me Just makes me want to hold on When even a fool would let go 'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying Even a child would say no When he knows that he'll end up crying Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you Even a fool would let go Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you When even a fool would let go
(Dolly Parton)My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter Something badly needed to brighten up the chores Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell In the water being used to scrub the floors Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home She believed in lots of work with little play And we laughed till we bent double Though we knew we'd get in trouble But trouble's all we had at evening shade Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding To teach you love and keep you off the streets And all the kids that live here are said to be a problem Juvenile delinquents so to speak But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger An iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate The reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared But they cared even less at evening shade Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this And so I started talking plans with the older kids Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene And I would get some matches when nobody seen Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway Now that its all over and the sun is going down There's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground 
(B. Tosti/R. O'Hearn)He takes the train into the city To him it's more than just a working day Cause he knows he can change the world in his ordinary way She's got a job, she has a family She tries to keep them both together She's barely getting by, saving everything she makes Day by day it seems it's getting harder to win How much longer, ready for their ship to come in These are the times of the everyday hero This is the battlefield of the working man Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can With a fire in his soul that keeps burning And a dream in her heart that won't die Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life They started out as high school sweethearts He promised her a life of luxury And though they don't have riches they have everything they need The eyes of her child are her diamonds The gift of his love are her pearls Together they plan, taking a stand to make this a better world But never breaking, knowing that their dreams will begin Getting stronger in each other's arms These are the times of the everyday hero This is the battlefield of the modern world There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can With a fire in our soul that keeps burning And a dream in our hearts that won't die Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life Everybody has a special reason There's a chosen road to follow Just remember nothing good comes easy Don't surrender till you you find your rainbow These are the times of the everyday hero This is the battlefield of the working man Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can With a fire in his soul that keeps burning And a dream in her heart that won't die Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life These are the times of the everyday hero This is the battlefield of the modern world There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can With a fire in our soul that keeps burning And a dream in our hearts that won't die Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
(Dolly Parton) When I look out over a green field of clover Or watch the sun set at the end of the day I get kind of moody when I see such beauty And everything's beautiful in its own way When I see a fountain flow from a mountain Or see April showers bring flowers to May I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder And everything's beautiful in its own way Words can't describe what I feel inside When I see the beauty in each coming day What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold And everything's beautiful in its own way When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm That uproots the harvest and hurls it away In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger The storm's even beautiful in its own way When I see leaves drop off from the treetop Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder God made all things beautiful in their own way Words can't describe what I feel inside When I see the beauty in each coming day What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold And everything's beautiful in its own way, in its own way, in its own way
Hardest thing I?ve ever done, or that I?ll ever doWas to just walk off and leave you, but I knew I had to leave youCause I couldn?t stay and watch you falling out of love with meThe worst pain I?ve ever known, or that I?ll ever knowWas to see your love a dying, and I have to watch it dyingAnd I couldn?t stand to watch you falling out of love with meIt?s hurting now but still it?s better, I left while love was still aliveIt was dying and I?d rather, I didn?t have to watch it dieThe deepest hurt I?ve ever felt, or that I?ll ever feelWas to know that I was losing, and I tried but I keep losingAnd I couldn?t stay and watch you falling out of love with meThe loneliest I?ve ever been, or that I?ll ever beIs now that I?m without you, and I feel so lost without youBut I couldn?t stay and watch you falling out of love with meIt?s hurting now but still it?s better, I left while love was still aliveIt was dying and I?d rather, I didn?t have to watch it dieIt was dying and I?d rather, I didn?t have to watch it die
(Bob Tubert & Demetrius Tapp)Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play They say there home town girl made good and she'd go a long long way Mom wonders why I don't drive back in that big fine car I own The truth is I don't have a car and I'm ashamed to go back home A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit These are all my possessions all I have to my name And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame I'm so glad that dad can't see me now, his favorite little girl Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit These are all of my possessions, all I have to my name And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame Yes a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame

Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day longWhile there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrongWhen death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and drearyThen do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after yearFarther along we'll know all about it; farther along we'll understand whyCheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and byFaithful till death said our loving master; a few more days to labor and waitToils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gatesFarther along we'll know all about it...Yes, we'll understand it all by and by

The first noel, the angel did say,Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,On a cold winter's night that was so deep.Noel, noel, noel, noel,Born is the king of Israel.They looked up and saw a starShining in the east, beyond them far;And to the earth it gave great light,And so it continued both day and night.Noel, noel, noel, noel,Born is the king of Israel.And by the light of that same star,Three wise men came from country far;To seek for a king was their intent,And to follow the star wherever it went.Noel, noel, noel, noel,Born is the king of Israel.This star drew night to the northwest,O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;And there it did both stop and stay,Right over the place where Jesus lay.Noel, noel, noel, noel,Born is the king of Israel.Then entered in those wise men three,Full reverently upon their knee;And offered there in his presence,Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.Noel, noel, noel, noel,Born is the king of Israel.
(Dolly Parton)I feel so out of place here With this high society These high fallutin' people Don't know what to make of me I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks A small fry in a big pan They're caviar -- I'm fish sticks Fish out of water I know I don't belong Fish out of water Everything I do is wrong My style of hair, the clothes I wear The way I speak, the things I eat The way I act, my lack of tact Nothin' seems to fit Fish out of water Flounderin' round Out of my element But I'm just as good as they are Why do I feel second rate It's like, "Sorry Charlie, We want only tuna with good taste" I guess you could say Wal-Mart Is quite a way from Gucci's I'm Timex, they're Rolex I'm Captain D's, they're sushi Fish out of water I've had it to the gills Fish out of water With these yuppie-guppie frills Yeah, I'm a square in a round hole A catfish in a goldfish bowl A little fish with lots of soul Out of my element Fish out of water Flounderin' round just for the Halibut Save me, save me S.O.S. somebody Save me, save me Somebody rescue me Fish out of water Somebody throw me in Fish out of water On a scale of one to ten I'm a two, perhaps a three Compared to the big fish in the sea I'm washed ashore so save me please I'm in an awful fix Fish out of water Rescue me And you better do it quick Fish out of water It's such a culture shock Fish out of water My stomach's tied in knots Fish out of water Fish out of water
Don't look so sad; I know it's over But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning [Chorus:]Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the rain drops Blowing soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good times I'll get along, and you'll find another And I'll be here if you should find you ever need Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me [Chorus]For the good times For the good times

You kindle the fire of love inside me Each time our lips meet I'm not strong when we're alone Your kisses make me weak You must know how I feel But do you feel the same Everytime you kiss me You add fuel to the flame My eyes light up when I see you I burn with desire Each time you're near You say you'll care But still I'm not sure But please don't ask me to love you If you're not gonna change my name Everytime you touch me You add fuel to the flame This fire you started inside me Has reached my very soul You're adding fuel to a flame That's already burning out of control When you give me your name I give you everything Everytime you kiss me Adds fuel to the flame Yes everytime you touch me You add fuel to the flame
You've seen me naked in more ways than oneYou've seen me done up, seen me come undoneWe've cried in the darkness, we've laughed in the sunWe've been forever, yet we've just begunWe've come full circle, all the way 'roundThrough the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downsStill we've stayed together through thick and through thinYes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friendsAnd you know the soft spots under my skinDeep down inside me, where no one has beenWe've sailed troubled waters, we've soared on the windBut time's only sweetened this love that we're inAnd we've come full circle, all the way 'roundThrough the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downsStill we've stayed together through thick and through thinYes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friendsWe've cried in the darkness, laughed in the sunWe've come full circle and we've just begunWe've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round(We've come full circle)We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'roundYou know we've cried in the darkness and we've laughed in the sun(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)But we've stayed together and we've just begun(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)I'm so glad you're still my friend(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)We've come full circle
Being born was the worse and the first mistake I ever madeThe doctor didn't spank me, he just slapped me in the faceAnd the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirstLeaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt'Cause I was raised an orphanNever wanted as a kid until the year I turned 13Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forthMen just took me as they pleasedAnd others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep Though the deck is stacked against youWin or lose, you have to playThe hand a life has dealt youAnd It's a gamble either way On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dressWith the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neckAnd the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric timeOr should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behindA 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching ridesBut sometimes when you're riding freeYou'll pay the highest priceOn back roads and in back seatsAnd in a cheap highway motelBut what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else Though the deck is stacked against youWin or lose, you have to playThe hand a life has dealt youAnd It's a gamble either way 16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet lightOn the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy nightWhen I walked into the parlour hereOther pieces seemed to fitI was good at pleasing strangersSo I made the most of it Either way it's all a gambleSo view the stakes and know the oddsAnd lay your cards upon the tableDo all the dealing from the top Though the deck is stacked against youWin or lose, you have to playThe hand a life has dealt youAnd It's a gamble either way

(Dolly Parton)Sometimes in my sleep I hold you close against my skin Wakin' up I wish that I could sleep and dream again 'Cause only in my dreams can I know how it might have been But cheaters never win, Their Heartaches never end But sometimes I get crazy as lovers often do Trying to please him and wondering if she's pleasin' you Though they have ever right to any part of us they choose I still live just for you and our secret rendezvous Torn between two lovers on the jukebox I'm thinkin' how I could have wrote that song Wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin' Oh, but why he lets us feel things if it's wrong And I guess I should be gingin' "Rock of Ages" "Amazing Grace" and some of those good songs But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong Thou shalt not commit, it's written in the ten The spirit's always willin', but the flesh is weak again And you're as close to heaven as I might ever fly And angel in disguise A wrong that feels so right Torn between two lovers just keeps playing I don't want to be right if lovin' you is wrong I'm wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin' Oh, but why we have to feel things if it's so wrong I guess I should be singin' "Rock of Ages" "Amazing Grace" and some of those good songs But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong My cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
Today as I was walkingIn the fields just down the wayI sat down on a fallen logTo pass the time awayAnd as I looked around meThe more that I did lookThe more I realize that I am viewingGod's coloring bookI saw a golden ray of sunlightA silver drop of dewA soft, white floating cloudSailing cross the sky 'a blueA yellow dandelionPretty evergreenAnd some red and orange flowersGrowing wild along the streamAnd the more I look around meAnd the more that I do lookThe more I realize that I am viewingGod's coloring bookThe greyness in an old man's hairThe pink in baby's cheeksThe blackness in a stormy skyThe brown in fallen leavesAnd the multicolored rainbowStretched out across the skyAnd the purple haze at sunsetJust before the nightAnd the more I look around meAnd the more that I do lookThe more I realize that I am viewingGod's coloring bookThen I turn my face toward the skyAnd say a silent prayerThough God doesn't speak to meI see him everywhereHe is all around meHe's everywhere I lookAnd each new day is but a new pageIn god's coloring bookTag:Each new day is but a new pageIn god's coloring bookHmmmmmm

(Dolly Parton)We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land And quenched our thirst with rain We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me All we had was each other and the rags upon our back The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me Well the winter came and the snow did fall And the night was cold and still And the rags we wore were not enough And Joe he caught the chill And he told me how he loved me And in my arms he went to sleep Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me While standin' here on the edge of this bridge Lookin' down I see The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me Tonight we'll be together again Gypsy, Joe and me 
(Dolly Parton)Halos and horns, sinners and saints, Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't Just because it feels right does not make it so So we struggle through life in horns and halos Tempted and tried with each step we take We stumble and slide and make our mistakes, Ask God to forgive us for all of our sins, Then we take off our horns and wear halos again Halos and horns, sinners and saints, Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't Just because it feels right does not make it so So we struggle through life in horns and halos Halos and horns, sinners and saints, We're praised or we're scorned, we either run or we faint Oh, but life is a challenge from the day that we're born Just tryin' to balance halos and horns It's heaven or hell, halos or horns Halos and horns, sinners and saints, Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't But just because it feels right; well, that don't make it so So we struggle through life in horns or halos It's either horns or halos

Chorus: A heartsong melody play like a symphony The sweetest music I have ever known A song of joy and pain The mountain angels sing A bittersweet refreign of my Smokey Mountain Home, heartsong Farmer's daughter if you will And I often wonder still In memories where I rammbled as a child Makes me cry and makes me laugh My reflections on the past And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs Just enough to go around But the sweetest things in life are always free Like the songs the birds would sing And the sweet new grass of spring And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree Repeat Chorus And I recall the thrill and joy Of a Smokey Mountain boy I remember my first kiss and my first love And the songs I'd song and write And the dreams I'd clutch so tight And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove And in that little house 'a prayer Where I spent many hour Prassin' God and liftin' up His name And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me As I headed up that rocky road to fame And now this, Smokey Mountain girl has been all around the world But it makes no difference just how far I roam I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart My faith in God and memories of home Repeat Chorus

The gates and doors were barred And all the windows fastened down I spent the night in sleeplessness And rose at every sound Half in hope of sorrow And half in fear the day Would find the soldiers breakin' through To drag us all away And just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall The gate began to rattle And a voice began to call I hurried to the window Looked down into the street Expecting swords and torches And the sound of soldiers' feet But there was no one there but Mary So I went down to let her in John stood there beside me As she told me where she'd been She said they've moved Him in the night And none of us know where The stone's been rolled away And now His body isn't there We both ran towards the garden Then John ran on ahead We found the stone and empty tomb Just the way that Mary said But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in Was just an empty shell And how or where they'd taken Him Was more than I could tell Oh something strange had happened there Just what I did not know John believed a miracle But I just turned to go Circumstance and speculation Couldn't lift me very high 'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him Then I saw Him die Back inside the house again The guilt and anguish came Everything I'd promised Him Just added to my shame When at last it came to choices I denied I knew His name And even if He was alive It wouldn't be the same But suddenly the air was filled With a strange and sweet perfume Light that came from everywhere Drove shadows from the room And Jesus stood before me With His arms held open wide And I fell down on my knees And I just clung to Him and cried Then He raised me to my feet And as I looked into His eyes The love was shining out from Him Like sunlight from the skies Guilt in my confusion Disappeared in sweet release And every fear I ever had Just melted into peace He's alive yes He's alive Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide He's alive yes He's alive Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide He's alive He's alive Hallelujah He's alive He's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide He's alive He's alive He's alive I believe it He's alive Sweet Jesus

The first strange town I was ever inThe county was hangin' a manAnd nobody cared if he lived or he diedAnd I just didn't understand So I washed my face in the morning dewBathed my soul in the sunWashed my face in the morning dewAnd kept on moving along The second strange town I was inThey were laughing at a poor crippled manBegging for nickels and dimes on the streetAnd I just didn't understand So I washed my face in the morning dewBathed my soul in the sunWashed my face in the morning dewAnd kept on moving along The third strange town that I was inWas settled peaceful and niceThe rich got richer and the poor got poorerAnd to me it didn't seem right So I washed my face in the morning dewBathed my soul in the sunWashed my face in the morning dewAnd kept on moving along Now someday times are bound to changeIt can't be very farAnd each injustice that I have seenWill come before the bar Then I'll wash my face in the morning dewBathe my soul in the sunWash my face in the morning dewAnd my journey will be done

(Porter Wagoner)If I cross your mind, please let me cross it slowly Let me stop and reminisce with you for a while And if I cross your mind, please remember only good things Think of me as happiness if I cross your mind There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind And if there's one of me love, among them that you find Please stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind When you think of me love, if I cross your mind If you must hide my memory when you're with someone else Then make mine very special when you're by yourself For only in a memory can one turn back the time To lovely tender moments that linger in your mind There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind And if there's one of me love, among them that you find Won't you stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind When you think of me love, if I cross your mind Think of only good things if I cross your mind

(Bill Owens)I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience You seem to get worse every day I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away How long did you think you could keep on doing me wrong How long did you think I'd stay quiet and take it The love I had for you is almost gone And I ain't gonna let you take my heart and break it I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience You seem to get worse every day I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away You come and go just any time you want to And you never bother to tell me where your going And I wonder if there's anything you don't do Someday you'll pay for the wild seed your sewing I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience You seem to get worse every day I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away 
Oh I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyesWho is sailing all over the seaAnd I'm thinking tonight of him onlyAnd I wonder does he ever think of meCould been better for us both had we neverIn this wide wicked world had never metFor the pain and the pleasures he's brought meI am sure I will never forgetSo I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes...Oh you told me once dear that you love meAnd you swore that we never would partBut a linking the chain has been brokenLeaving me with a sad broken heartYes I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyesAnd I wonder does he ever think of me
Imagine there's no heavenIt's easy if you tryNo hell below usAbove us only skyImagine all the peopleLiving for today... Imagine there's no countriesIt isn't hard to doNothing to kill or die forAnd no religion tooImagine all the peopleLiving life in peace... You may say I'm a dreamerBut I'm not the only oneI hope someday you'll join usAnd the world will be as one Imagine no possessionsI wonder if you canNo need for greed or hungerA brotherhood of manImagine all the peopleSharing all the world... You may say I'm a dreamerBut I'm not the only oneI hope someday you'll join usAnd the world will live as one
At the beginning there was love and we thought it was enoughWe saw no farther than each other's armsAnd though the roof leaked o'er our heads just a blanket for our bedBut then we had our love to keep us warmBut the winter winds blew cold our new love was growing oldAnd our words were filled with anger and regretOur bills were more than we could pay and we both longed for the daysOf the freedom that we knew before we wedBut there was something greater still than all our fights and monthly billsIt was the knowledge of a child well on its wayAnd though we both longed to be free we talked it over and we agreedThat we'd wait till baby came to seperateThen at last the day arrived and the tears filled both our eyesAs we held our newborn baby in our armsAnd the love we thought was gone lived there three times as strongIt's not the end it's the beginning of our homeIt's not the end it's the beginning of our home mhm
As the snow flies On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' A poor little baby child is born In the ghetto And his mama cries 'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need It's another hungry mouth to feed In the ghetto People, don't you understand The child needs a helping hand Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day Take a look at you and me Are we too blind to see Do we simply turn our heads And look the other way Well the world turns And a hungry little boy with a runny nose Plays in the street as the cold wind blows In the ghetto And his hunger burns So he starts to roam the streets at night And he learns how to steal And he learns how to fight In the ghetto Then one night in desperation A young man breaks away He buys a gun, steals a car Tries to run, but he don't get far And his mama cries As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man Face down on the street with a gun in his hand In the ghetto As her young man dies On a cold and gray Chicago mornin' Another little baby child is born In the ghetto

It ain't fair for you to leave me cold and cryin' in the nightIt ain't fair to take your body from my arms and out of sightIt ain't fair you've gone and left me where you kissed me I still burnAre you leaving for my loving this awful hurt and then returnIt ain't fair for you to leave me alone to face the morning lightIt ain't fair you took my body and then to say that it ain't rightIt ain't fair you've made me your woman a no longer a good girl in your eyesHow come before you said you'd love me it ain't fair that it ain't rightIt just ain't fair that it ain't right

As I sit here tonight the jukebox's playingThe song about the wild side of lifeAs I listen to the words that you are sayingIt brings memories when I was a trusted wife It wasn't God who made honky tonk angelsAs you said in the words of your songToo many times married men think they're still singleAnd had caused many a good girl to go wrong It's a shame that all the blame is on us womenIt's not true that only you men feel the sameFrom the start most every heart that's ever brokenWas because there always was a man to blame It wasn't God who made honky tonk angelsAs you said in the words of your songToo many times married men think they're still singleAnd had caused many a good girl to go wrong

(Dolly Parton)Mine is a jealous heart Imagines things that never are Builds a fire from a tiny spark But that's the way of a jealous heart Sunny skies and a rosy bed Thorns and storm clouds up ahead 'Cause suddenly the sky turns dark For those of us with a jealous heart Imagination runnin' wild Like a frantic frightened child Any time that we're apart I can't control my jealous heart And you know mine is a jealous heart And every hurt leaves a lasting scar Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are When you're cursed with a jealous heart I love you more than words can tell One day's heaven two days hell Suspicious words like poison darts Spoken from my jealous heart Mine is a jealous heart Imagines things that never are Builds a fire from a tiny spark But that's the way of a jealous heart And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart And every hurt, and every hurt leaves a lasting scar Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are When you're cursed with a jealous heart And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart Imagines things, imagines things that never are Builds a fire from a tiny spark But that's the way of a jealous heart
Her two little feet would come rinning into our bedroom almost every nightHer soft little face would be wet from her tearsAnd her little heart pounding with frightShe'd hold out her arm then she'd climb in beside usIn a small voice we'd hear her remarkMommie and daddy can I sleep here with you cause Jeannie's afraid of the darkOne day in the summer we took some flowers to place on some old family graveJeannie said mommie ain't it dark in the ground oh daddy I'd be so afraidThen she looked up at her daddy and meAnd said somethin' that broke both our heartsShe said when I die please don't bury me cause Jeannie's afraid of the darkJeannie was always afraid of the dark and we never could understand whyCause we looked after Jeannie with the very best of careBecause Jeannie was our only childPerhaps it was death that she was so afraid ofCause it took her one dark stormy nightI think we always knew that we'd never see Jeannie grow upCause it seemed that she was destined to dieBut on Jeannie's grave we've placed en eternal flameThat glows and never loses its sparkAnd on the darkest night there's always a lightCause Jeannie's afraid of the dark our Jeannie's afraid of the dark

(Dolly Parton)John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes John Daniel was a young man, not more than twenty-four And there was an air about him that one could not ignore And in spite of callused hands & dirty clothes, his face was kind And I wanted so to know what was in John Daniel's mind John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan? I rented him a room; he went upstairs like all the rest It was Saturday and he'd be goin' in to town, I guessed But he left in a robe and sandals, with a Bible in his hand; And I thought to myself, John Daniel, I don't understand Now I'd planned to meet some friends of mine when I got off at three, In the park we often gather to talk of love and peace When I got there I found that a crowd had gathered 'round; And there I saw John Daniel a sittin' on the ground John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan? So, "You want to be free," he said, "Well, this is how you can." As he read from the Bible he held in his hand We were searchin' for the truth not knowin' where to look, Not knowin' that the answers all were in John Daniel's book John Daniel told us all how we could be free John Daniel taught us all a better way for you and me He came to us in our own way so we'd be sure to see He had the light and essence of the man from Galilee John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan? John Daniel, John Daniel, John Daniel John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan?

No we can't control the evil that surround usBut as long as we're together that's enoughIf there were just the two of us how different things would beNo one could come between us from now onThe wagging tongues would speak no more the sounds of gossip goneWithout a prying ear to fall uponNo we can't control the evil that surround usBut as long as we're together that's enoughThough we have no power over those around usWe can act as if there's just the two of us[ steel - fiddle ]Though clouds of doubt may drift about upon a stormy seaI'll only draw you nearer onto meAs long as we're together we'll never walk aloneWe'll build a world of sunshine of our ownNo we can't control the evil that surround us...
(Dolly Parton)If you hear me crying in the night Pretend that you don't hear me it's alright Don't ask me why I'm crying, please don't make a sound I don't know why, it's just the way I am And if you think I act a little strange And you don't understand when I do things Like running through the fields while the rain is pouring down I don't know why, it's just the way I am And even though you may not understand me I hope that you'll accept me like I am For there are many sides of me, my mind and spirit must be free And I might smile when other folks would frown I don't know why, it's just the way I am I might go out chasing butterflies And if I fail to catch one I might cry And if you want me you might find me in the meadow walking 'round I don't know why, it's just the way I am I might be home and busy cleaning house And in the middle of my work I might go out And go play games with children at the playground It makes me happy, and that's just the way I am And even though you may not understand me I hope that you'll accept me like I am For there are childish sides of me My mind and spirit must be free I might smile when you think I should frown I don't know why, it's just the way I am

(Dolly Parton)Beauty is a rare perfume Precious, yet doesn't last long Youth is but a playful breeze That blows our way once then moves on Love is a hidden treasure Some never find where it lies And memory is a little bird Flies through life, live or dies Little bird Take me aboard your beautiful wings and let me fly Fly me away back to yesterday And drop me off there awhile Let me smell the rare perfume of the sweet flower of beauty again Let me run in the playful breeze of youth long gone with the wind Let me sit for awhile by the place where I found the treasure of love Then sing me a song as you fly me along on our long last journey above
Oh dear I'm so tired and so lonesome I wonder why mommy don't come She told me to shut up my blue eyes And before I woke up she'd be home She said she was going to see Grandma Who lives by the river so wide And I guess my mommy's feeling bad And perhaps she won't be home tonight So I guess I'll go down and meet daddy Perhaps he has stopped at the store It's a great big store full of bottles And I wish he wouldn't go there anymore So out in the night with the baby Her little heart beating with pride 'Til her tired feet entered the gin palace With music all radiant with light Oh daddy she cried as she reached him I think that the music's so sweet But it's almost suppertime daddy Little blossom wants something to eat A moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly Down into her face sweet and fair And as the demon possessed him He grasped at the back of a chair A moment a second was over He lifted her fair golden head A moment the baby's left trembled Then poor little blossom was dead
(Dolly Parton)Little sparrow, little sparrow Precious fragile little thing Little sparrow, little sparrow Flies so high and feels no pain All ye maidens hede my warning Never trust the hearts of men They will crush you like a sparrow Leaving you to never mend They will vow to always love you Swear no love but yours will do Then they'll leave you for another Break your little heart in two Little sparrow, little sparrow Precious fragile little thing Little sparrow, little sparrow Flies so high and feels no pain If I were a little sparrow O'er these mountains I would fly I would find him, I would find him Look into his lying eyes I would flutter all around him On my little sparrow wings I would ask him, I would ask him Why he let me love in vain I am not a little sparrow I am just the broken dream Of a cold false-hearted lover And his evil cunning scheme Little sparrow, little sparrow Precious fragile little thing Little sparrow, little sparrow Flies so high and feels no pain All ye maidens fair and tender Never trust the hearts of men They will crush you like a sparrow Leaving you to never mend Little sparrow, little sparrow Oh the sorrow never ends 
(Dolly Parton)Spotlight's on, it's shining bright And I like standin' in it It's only superficial light But I don't want to end it It's warmth and glow has taken hold And I'm caught uup in it's shine A Cinderella fairy tale I want to claim as mine Fancy clothes, a magic coach And happy ever after Like something from a story book The Cinderella chapter But when the clock strikes midnight And I lie awake in bed Things my Daddy told me Keep running through my head You gotta walk the straight and narrow And to thine own self be true Gotta aim straight as an arrow All eyes are up on you But sometimes it feels so good That I can almost justify Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie Is it wrong for me to want The sweeter grass that's greener? To chase the all-American dream I've always been a dreamer At the top and still I've got A heavy heart inside I keep remembering Things my Daddy told me as a child You gotta walk the striaght and narrow Gotta hold fast to the right Gotta aim straight as an arrow Walk onward toward the light Oh, but when I'm out there in it I think I might get by Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie But I don't feel right livin' a lie Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie All the fame and fortune Glory and prestige Can't make me happy if it goes Against what I believe And I've sacrificed my honor My values and my pride Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie Livin' a lie Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, I don't feel right
My days are as dark as my nights And I see no sunshine in sight Your memory keeps blocking my view And I'm living on memories of you Can't eat when I'm hungry Can't sleep when I'm tired And all of these tears Can't put out this fire Your memory just won't turn me loose And I'm living on memories of you There's just no forgetting about you How long can I survive without you I just can't believe that we're through And I'm living on memories of you Can't eat when I'm hungry I can't sleep when I'm tired And all of my tears Can't drown out this fire Oh, your memory just won't turn me loose And I'm living on memories of you Yes, I'm living on memories of you
(Porter Wagoner)Loneliness found me one time too many And I cheated ? I cheated on you But I'd give my soul now if only I hadn't But you see what loneliness can do It seems that you're gone so much from me And I try to find things to do while you're gone But I get so lonesome just staying at home And it's hard to enjoy things alone Loneliness found me just one time too many And I cheated - yes, I cheated on you But I'd give my life now if only I hadn't But you see now what loneliness can do Loneliness found me
I woke up this morning in a strange place I looked into the mirror at a strange face Then I looked for you but you could not be found And then I felt the lonely comin' down I walked across the room to the empty bed Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head The presence of you still lingered all around And once again I felt the lonely comin' down Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face As I realized no one could take your place I wondered where the love had gone that we had found And then again I felt the lonely comin' down I wondered where the love had gone that we had found And again I felt the lonely comin' down Mmm
Your trembling hands held me nearYour soft warm lips whispered in my earYou said you'd always love meAnd we'd always be togetherAnd you promised me your love would last foreverIs forever longer than always?You're gone from me now and you have been for daysAnd in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stayUnless forever is longer than alwaysIs forever longer than alwaysYou're gone from me now and you have been for daysAnd in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stayUnless forever is longer than alwaysIs forever longer than always?
Hold my hand let's not lose my way hold my hand and lead me homeGuide each step that I might take hold my hand and keep me strong And let the path I walk be straight let the deeds I do be kindLet me never hesitate to help my brother walking blindHold my hand... And let my words have meaning of anything that I might speakIf you see me leaning on just hold my hand and straighten meHold my hand...Amen
That's the way love is you have to love and learnI've lost again but can't I win these tears that I cried make my eyes burnEach new love I'd find turns out to deepen the wrong timeAnd it looks like I'll just have to love and learnLove and learn just hurt and yearn for someone who will love me in returnI'll be hurt many times before the right one I findBut that's the way love is you have to love and learn[ steel ]Love and learn...Yes that's the way love is you have to love and learn

(Bill Owens)Love is only as strong as your weakest moment And in that moment of weakness anyone can do wrong Oh, weak woman, like a crooked river Follows a path of least resistance I went in the wrong place at the right time Where I didn't have any business Temptation overcame me and now I I'm ashamed of me But how can I ask the one I love For his forgiveness Love is only as strong as your weakest moment And in that moment of weakness Anyone can go wrong 
(Porter Wagoner)Your love's as fresh in my memory as this morning's sunrise And still just as beautiful to me I can still feel the soft touch of love sweet and tender You give me love to remember Nights with no ending, filled with love I'm remembering Each night that I spend with you I can still feel your soft touch, I can still feel your warm love You give me love to remember And each morning when I wake up Before I leave my pillow. I search through my dreams carefully Just to make sure that I don't leave one tiny memory 'Cause I dream of the love I remember Nights with no ending, filled with love I'm remembering Each night that I spend with you I can still feel your warm love, I can still feel your soft touch You give me love to remember Love to remember

Another sleepless night alone, crazy from this jealousy.I heard you call her on the phone,Watched you shave and dress and leave.Walk the floor and watch the clock,Knowing that you ain't missing me.Imagination runnin' hot, and you're right where you wanna be.Do you think I'm made of stone?Do you think it doesn't hurt when you leave me here alone,Leaving me to think the worst?And when you're out there in her arms 'til the wee hours of the dawn,Do you think it's all a joke?Can't you see my heart is broke?Do you think I'm made of stone?I'm just barely gettin' 'round,Don't know how I'm getting by.All our friends I meet in town,They just can't look me in the eye.They all know you're runnin' 'round.Like me, they don't know what to do.God, I hate their sympathy,But I just can't turn loose of you.But do you think I'm made of stone?Don't you know my pain is real?It's the worst I've ever known just stayin' at an even keel.Oh, what am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?I should leave, I know I should;I just only wish I could.Do you think I'm made of stone?Oh, it cuts me like a knife,You have stripped me of my pride.What am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?Do you think it's all a joke?Can't you see my heart is broke?Do you think I'm made of stone?Another sleepless night alone,I guess you think I'm made of stone.
(E. Kaz)Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams And anything is possible for those who can believe Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities For us to make love work We've got to try a little harder And for love to work we gotta hold on A human heart is just too precious To spend it feeling hurt Let's start to take the chance to make love work It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you For us to make love work We've got to try a little bit harder And for love to work we gotta hold on A human heart is just too precious To spend it feeling hurt Let's start to take the chance to make love work Oh I do believe in miracles But I know they don't come easy So why don't we give destiny A helping hand For us to make love work We've got to try a little bit harder And for love to work we gotta hold on A human heart is just too precious To spend it feeling hurt Let's start to take the chance to make love work Life is just too beautiful To spend it feeling hurt Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Making believe that you still love me It's leaving me alone and so blue I'll always dream, still I'll never own you Making believe, its all I can do Can't hold you close when you're not with me You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime Loving you and making believe Making believe that I never lost you But my happy hours are fun and so few My plans for the future will never come true Making believe what else can I do Can't hold you close when you're not with me You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime Loving you and making believe

On a cold winty night as the winds blew across the wild moorPoor Mary came wandering home with her childTill she came at her own father's doorPapa oh papa she cried come down and open the doorOr the child in my arms will perish and dieFrom the winds that blow across the wild moorBut the man was deaf to her cry not a sound of her voice did he hearWhile the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolledThe winds blew across the wild moorOh how the old man must have feltWhen he came to the door the next mornAnd found Mary dead but the child yet aliveClutched close to his dead mother's breastNow the old man in grief pined awayAnd the day to it's mother went soonAnd no one they say has lived there to this dayAnd the cottage is left to ruinsNow the villagers point out the placeWhere the willows droop over the doorSaying there Mary died once a gay village brideFrom the winds that blew across the wild moorFrom the winds that blew across the wild moor

(Dolly Parton)A little white house with black wooden shadows A porch with its columns all covered with vine My broken dream house where he lives with another But this was supposed to be mine Two little children that look like their daddy With the same smile and the same eyes that shine The only thing wrong I'm not their mommy But they were supposed to be mine He's given to her what he promised to me The plans that we made never can be For each night he holds and carresses another And she is supposed to be me He's given to her what he promised to me The plans that we made never can be For each night he holds and carresses another And she is supposed to be me And he is supposed to be mine

(Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton) Tonight all is quiet in Mission Chapel And the music, like his love, has died away And I'm standing in the middle of these memories Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day I see the rice still scattered all around That veil upon my satin wedding gown And the wedding bells that rang are silent now Only Mission Chapel memories all around Tonight I'm all alone at Mission Chapel And I'm thinking of my love so far away While I'm standing in the middle of all these memories Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day I see the rice still scattered all around That veil upon my satin wedding gown The gown I wore when I became his bride And now these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes As these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes 
(Dolly Parton)The snow was fallin' swiftly and it mounted on the street Little footprints in the snow made by our children's feet As I walked them to the good will store to get some clothes to wear As we turned around the corner I saw you standing there I tried to turn the children and walk the other way I prayed they hadn't seen you then I heard the baby say "Mommie, ain't that Daddy holding out his hand Begging for money from that other man?" They asked me "Ain't that Daddy?" And "Yes" I had to say And I wondered if I'd failed you And made you turn this way No, you didn't fail me, my weakness was just too strong Because you see, I thought more of the bottle than our family and our home No, you didn't fail me sweetheart, you loved me all you could You had my babies and you loved me like no other woman ever would You know I guess I'd be better off dead Than in the awful ship I'm in But death just don't seem to have a place for those that stay drunk on whiskey, wine and gin You see I die a constant death over and over every day If I could change, you know I'd do it for you, the babies and our home But you might as well forget me for I'm just too forward gone But I wish you would do me one last favor and do it just for me When they ask you, "Momma ain't that Daddy?" Just say "It used to be" 
(Dolly Parton)Your love is like a gentle breeze That's always blowin' over me I know you're all I'll ever need In each and every way You're both ends of the rainbow My colors and my pot of gold I love you with a love untold More than I can say You are the song of every bird You are the poet's every word Every artist's picture Every writer's play You are the glow in every night You are the warmth in each sunrise Makes no difference how I try It's more than I can say And when I've needed you You've always been there for me Been my friend and stood by me And held me as you loved the world away And when I've wanted you You have satisfied my needs Fullfilled all my fantasies I love you more and more each day More than I can say Oh and sometimes I watch you gently sleep Listen as you softly breathe Touch you skin and kiss you sweet And love you all the way I reach for you You come to me Love me into ecstacy I will love you endlessly More than I can say And when I've needed you You've always been there for me Been my friend and stood by me And held me as you loved the world away And when I've wanted you You have satisfied my needs Fullfilled all my fantasies I love you more and more each day More than I can say I love you more and more each day More than I can say More than I can say More than I can say More than I can say

We once were so close now the love light that glowed has now gone out of our livesAnd the good life we had for some reason went badAnd the love that once lived here has diedHow did we get here where did it start when did we walk out of each other's heartWhere did we lose it how did love die when where and how but most of all whyMost of all why did we let love die like the withering leaves in the fallAnd why did we wait till it was too late to realize how much we'd lostHow did we get here...When where and how but most of all why
(Dolly Parton)Pretty as an angel from the day that she was born Skin as fair as Lily's hair, as golden as the corn They knew that she was special from the moment she first cried She was a mountain angel certified She was her momma's baby, she was her daddy's pride Good at home, at church and school, at everything she tried Everybody's darlin' led a charmed and peaceful life The perfect mountain angel 'til he arrived And ohh, she fell so deeply Ooh, she couldn't stop She gave herself to him, milled it completely He lifted her so high he let her drop She gave up everything for him that mattered in her life All the others that had loved her and she vowed to be his wife She dreamed of bearing children in an ivy-covered house The mountain angel's sunshine turned to clouds The wicked handsome stranger left the way he came Broke her heart and broke her mind She never was the same They say he was the devil That had come to steal her soul She never loved another it was told They say she had a baby Some say that it had died They it's just as well As it had been the devil's child They say good conquers evil But here, evil won the prize So the mountain angel took to the wild And ooh, she couldn't take it Years passed and she had long since lost her mind She waited for him as her beauty faded Her parents died from grief before their time She tried to gather pieces of her life, they wouldn't fit Beside the tiny grave deep in the woods is where she'd sit Talking to the child, herself, to him, who knew for sure Possessed they say by satan's insane lure High a'top the mountain, for years they say she's seen Looking down upon the town where she had once been queen She'd sneak around the playground, watch the little children play They'd see the crazy lady then run away They say she roamed these hills for years, wearing not a stitch The lovely mountain angel now thought to be a witch She made those wailing mournful sounds That you could hear for miles Long after she laid down upon her baby's grave and died And ooh, her ghost is callin' She's waiting for the ones that she adored Through spring and summer, fall when snow is fallin' Her spirit roams these hills forever more The mountain angel's voices ever more Oohh, oooo Oohh, oooo Oohh, oooo

(Dolly Parton)From a shack by a mountain stream To a room in New Orleans So far from my Blue Ridge Mountain home The men I meet ain't warm and friendly Like the one in old Virginie Oh they ain't real like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy I was just a little past eighteen When I came to New Orleans I'd never been beyond my home state line There was a boy who loved me dearly But I broke his heart severely When I left my Blue Ridge Mountain boy Life was dull in my hometown Lights were out when the sun went down And I thought that city life was more my style But nights get lonely away from home And it's easy to go wrong The men ain't kind like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy New Orleans held things in store Things I'd never bargained for And every night a different man knocks on my door But late at night when all is still I can hear a whippoorwill As I cry for my Blue Ridge Mountain boy Oh but I can never go back home Since the boy I love is gone He grew tired of waiting for me to return They say he married last October But I never will get over Oh the sweet love of my Blue Ridge Mountain boy Blue Ridge Mountain boy 
(Dolly Parton)Fly away from my window little blue bird Fly as far as you can away from here And let not your song fall upon my ear Go spread your blue wings and I'll shed my blue tears For the one that I have loved He has left me and gone An' I'm in no mood for to hear your sad song Bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here Oh, trouble me not Go ye elsewhere Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away An' I'm in no mood for the sunshine today Go spread your blue wings Go light your blue sky An' I'll shed my blue tears

Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoonIn a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wallWatch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a stringAnd chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall[Chorus]In my Tennessee mountain homeLife is as peaceful as a baby's sighIn my Tennessee mountain homeCrickets sing in the fields near byHoneysuckle vine clings to the fence along the laneTheir fragrance makes the summer wind so sweetAnd on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wingsAn' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody[Chorus]Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' loveJust laughin', talkin', making future plansAnd when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or twoSittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands[Chorus]
Chorus:Ive got a never ending love for youFrom now on, that's all I want to doFrom the first time we met I knewId have a never ending love for youAfter all this time of being aloneWe can love one anotherFeel for each otherFrom now onFeel so good I can hardly stand itRepeat chorus
(Dolly Parton/Floyd Parton)I used to stand on a corner when I was a child And I'd play my guitar and sing as the people went by The sidewalks were crowded but I'd just sing louder cause I didn't mind Just spending my time, spinning my rhymes and singing for nickels and dimes Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes I'd brighten their day as they go on their way and they'd brighten mine A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind I knew that someday in my own special I'd repay all their nickels and dimes I recall the sidewalk each night as I stand on the stage As I play my guitar and sing for the people who paid Cause I finally made it to what they all call the big time But I still remember I still owe some nickels and dimes Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind So if you remember a child on the corner of time You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind So if you remember a child on a corner of time You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind So if you remember a child on a corner of time You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes

The truth is too painfulThis moment too realSaying good-byeBut loving you stillToo late to start overWe've tried that beforeAnd I just don't have it in meTo try anymore But I know I'll miss youAnd I know I'll cryI know you loved meAnd I know you've triedIt's the hardest thingI'll ever do in my lifeBut I know no good wayOf saying good-bye I know I'll miss youAnd I know I'll cryI know you loved meAnd I know I'll ask whyI know I'll have momentsWhen I'll want to dieBut I know no good wayOf saying good-bye And the longest nightI'll ever spend will be tonight'Cause I know no good way of saying
(Dolly Parton)Birds sing for everyone but me, for me it rains And I can't hear the music for the pain I see such happiness for some, but not for me With love, I always try so hard to get it right I find it gone just when I think I might Regretfully I see it last for some, but not for me Out of reach of all the things I want to have and hold I've come to just accept that's how it goes I've come so close Not for me, it's not for me to question, I suppose But I keep wonderin' what the future holds Why must it be? That life's so sweet for some, but not for me Birds sing for everyone but me, for me it rains And I can't see the sunshine for the pain But I see such happiness for some, but not for me For me it rains, there's only pain It's not for me 
little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lieAbove Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go byYet in Thy dark street shineth the everlasting lightThe hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight O holy Child of Bethlehem descent to us we prayCast out our sins and enter in be born in us todayWe hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tellOh come to us abide with us our Lord Emmanuel Yet in Thy dark street shineth...O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lieAbove Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
He walks in my mind like a shadowSomeone speaks his name and he appearsI can see his face in total darknessOh, he's everywhereHe left a memory that lives with meA memory of how it used to beAnd I remember all the things we used to shareOh, he's everywhere He waits in the corners of my mindAnd in the stillness of the night, he walks aroundSometimes his memory's so real I think he's really thereOh, he's everywhere He left a memory that lives with meA memory of how it used to beI remember all the things we used to shareOh, he's everywhereOh, he's everywhere
(Dolly Parton)Well I remember when I was just little Mama used to cook on an old black kettle On an old wood stove she'd had since she was wed Well the oven door was sprung a little bit So we propped it up with a forked stick But that didn't matter cause Mama kept us fed My mama and daddy must have loved each other Cause I had eleven sisters and brothers And the girls worked just as hard as the boys did There was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it We might have been poor but we didn't know it We'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant Oh we used to have such a good life And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known And oh didn't we have such a good time It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone Well there was nothing that pleased us any better Than when we got an occasional letter From kin folks livin' up north in some big town We'd think of all the games we'd play And we just couldn't hardly wait When our city cousins said they'ze a comin' down Now Mama's done away with the old black kettle She used to cook in when I was just little And the door ain't sprung on her electric range That little farm and home we had It ain't there no more and that's too bad Folks are doin' away with the simple things And oh we used to have such a good life And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known And oh didn't we have such a good time It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone Now, I just mean to say the simple things are gone The old black kettle's gone 
Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who I use to take comfort from long before I met you I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire Old flames can't hold a candle to you No one can light up the night like you do Flickering embers of love I've known one or two But old flames can't hold a candle to you Sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn Old flames can't hold a candle to you No one can light up the night like you do Flickering embers of love I've known one or two But old flames can't hold a candle to you Old flames can't hold a candle to you

You're gone now for good and it looks like I couldStop crying but I cry just the sameWhen a heart breaks how long does it takeTill the pain stops and only the mem'ry remainsIt's been a long time and you think that by this timeMy tears would have drown on the faceI could live with a mem'ry oh but how long will it beTill the pain stops and only the mem'ry remainsThe fire that we started burns on though we partedAnd our torture by the heat of the flameIf I'm strong enough to take it till the pain stops and can make itWhen only the mem'ry remainsI could live with a mem'ry but how long will it beTill the tears stop and the pain stops and only the mem'ry remainsOnly the mem'ry only the mem'ry remains

Writer Dolly PartonCopyright 1973The mid summer sun shines but dim the fields try in vain to look gayBut when I was happy with him December was pleasant as MayThere once was a time he and I picked flowers to braid in my hairAnd the songbirds would sing sweet song of love that was tender and fairNo difference the seasons may quit our love was as warm as the sunAnd it mattered not where did the snowOr green grass kissed the fields where we'd runNow the mid summer sun shines...Sweet flowers sweet birds and sweet song have now lost their sweetness to meFor ever my darling is gone and for ever my heartbroken I'll beNow the mid summer sun shines...The mid summer sun shines but dim mmm

(Dolly Parton)I have rocked you to sleep like a baby Stood beneath you and lifted you up I have given you comfort and safety Now you've gone in the prime of our love I have cradled your head on my pillow Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup I have bowed to your needs like a willow Now you've gone in the prime of our love Oh, the days are slow in their passing And the nights are so dreadfully dull And the question my heart keeps on asking Why'd you leave in the prime of our love? I have cradled your head on my pillow Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup I have bowed to your needs like a willow Now you've gone in the prime of our love In the prime of our love you've forsaken Our bright hopes and just left them to fade And the heart that was yours for the breaking Lies in pieces to wither away I have cradled your head on my pillow Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup I have bowed to your needs like a willow Now you've gone in the prime of our love In the prime of our love you've forsaken Our bright hopes and just left them to fade And the heart that was yours for the breaking Lies in pieces to wither away Lies in pieces as cold as the clay

(Dolly Parton)There will come a day when sorrow fades away, And anguish and heartache shall ease, No mothers cryin', no soldiers dyin', And turmoil and misery shall cease. The hungry shall be fed, the aimless shall be led And sad eyes will no longer weep, The last shall be first, through heaven he'll burst With his heavenly host from the East Weapons to plowshares, hate turns to love, Descending from heaven he'll sweep down to us In radiant splendor; oh, won't it be sweet When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace (Raven dove) Oh, there will come a day when I'll fly away Forever to be in his keep Eternal life in the sweet by and by When raven dove, raven dove speaks When lambs walk with lions, a child tames the beast Nations shall gather and bow at his feet And loved ones shall rise up from their earthly sleep And he'll separate all the chaff from the wheat. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, how sweet When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace Raven dove, behold he cometh in the clouds And every eye shall see him Sweet bird, sweet bird of peace Raven Dove

There are stars in the southern sky Southward as you go There is moonlight and moss in the trees Down the seven bridges road I have loved you like a baby Like some lonesome child I have loved you in a tame way And I have loved you wild Sometimes there is a part of me Has to turn from here and go Runnin' like a child from these warm stars Down the seven bridges road There are stars in the southern sky And if ever you decide you should go There is a taste of time sweet as honey Down the seven bridges road There are stars in the southern sky Southward as you go There is moonlight and moss in the trees Down the seven bridges road Down the seven bridges road
(Dolly Parton)I used to sit for hours as a kid Dangle my feet from an old flat bridge, Seein' myself in the water below Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw I recall a vacant old shack Down by the edge of the tobaccer patch A child's reflection in a dirty window Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw A long time gone and a long time ago When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw The world is cruel and people are cold They shatter my image with the stones they throw Shatter my image with the stones they throw I'm far from perfect, but I ain't all bad; It hurts me more than it makes me mad You gather your stones by stoopin' so low Then shatter my image with the stones you throw If you live in a glass house, don't throw stones Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own Look at your reflection in your house of glass Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash A long time gone and a long time ago When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw The world is cruel and people are cold They shatter my image with the stones they throw Shatter my image with the stones they throw A long time gone and a long time ago When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw The world is cruel and people are cold They shatter my image with the stones they throw Shatter my image with the stones they throw Shatter my image with the stones you throw, Don't shatter my image with the stones you throw Shatter my image with the stones you throw, Shatter my image with the stones you throw, Shatter my image with the stones you throw, You shatter my image with the stones you throw Shatter my image with the stones you throw, You shatter my image with the stones you throw Shatter my image with the stones you throw, You shatter my image with the stones you throw Shatter my image with the stones you throw, You shatter my image with the stones you throw

I've been down on my luck,I've been shadowed with trouble and sorrow.But I ain't givin' up''Cause I know there is always tomorrow.There are no guarantees,Life is always a hit or a miss.But I truly believeI won't always be feeling' like this.I'm gonna shine like the sunWhen these clouds roll away from my door.When it's all said and doneI won't be at your mercy no more.I will prove my own worth,Heal the damage and hurt that's been done.And when the cryin's all done.Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.I've been thinking here latelyWhat all I can do to improve.Though I've suffered greatly,I know just what I have to do.I have to move forward,Cut losses, break loose and move on.And I have to swim shorewardLest I should drown out here alone.I'm gonna shine like the sunWhen these clouds roll away from my door.I won't crawl I can runI'll be at no ones mercy no more.I'll be swinging on sunbeamsSo proud that I finally won.And when the losin's all done.Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine.I'm gonna shine like the sun.When these clouds roll away from my door.And when it's all said and doneI won't be at your mercy no more.I'll be off chasin' rainbows,Rejoicin' and havin' my fun.And when the cryin's all done,Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.When the cryin's all done,When the tryin's all done,When the lyin's all doneThere'll be nothin' but sun.When it's all said and doneWell, I'm gonna shine like the sun.Shine like the sun, shine like the sun.

Well, I met an old man walkin' down the street His clothes were torn and tattered With sandals on his feet And I stopped to help him And lend him a hand He said, I love you so much But you must understand Silver and gold might buy you a home But things of this world They won't last you long And time has a way of turning us old And time can't be bought back with silver and gold And he said to me, let's rest for awhile For I have some good news to share with you, child He said, you can't change this old world The people need to know That a dear savior died here A long, long time ago Silver and gold might buy you a home But things of this world They won't last you long And time has a way of turning us old And time can't be bought back with silver and gold His eyes shown like diamonds And his smile was heaven sent His hair was long and flowing And his back was slightly bent And I knew he knew it For that day I changed As I watched him walk on I forgot to get his name He said, silver and gold can't buy you a home When this life has ended And your time is gone But you can live in a world where You'll never grow old And things can't be bought there with silver and gold And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

Silver threads and golden needlesCannot mend this heart of mineAnd I'll never drown my sorrowIn the warm glow of your wine You can't buy my love with moneyFor I never was that kindSilver threads and golden needlesCannot mend this heart of mine I don't want your golden mansionsWith a tear in every roomAll I want's the love you promisedBeneath the halo moon But you think I should be happyWith your money and your nameAnd hide myself in sorrowWhile you play your cheatin' game Silver threads and golden needlesCannot mend this heart of mineAnd I'll never drown my sorrowIn the warm glow of your wine You can't buy my love with moneyFor I never was that kindSilver threads and golden needlesCannot mend this heart of mine
(Frieda Parton/Mark Andersen)You may not know me now But I have been around You'll never see my name on any pages I'm just the common man The fool who understands The pain you go through When life takes you under So, sing for the common man A song for the common man He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow He will survive, he will survive You may not know my mother My sisters or my brothers Yet everyone has given for the other You know the working man He builds what others plan So, everyone of us should sing his story So, sing for the common man A song for the common man He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow He will survive, he will survive Dat after day He keeps working away In offices, factories, and farms Year after year He sheds tear after tear He will provide, he will survive So, sing for the common man A song for the common man He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow He will survive, he will survive
Single bars and single womenWith a single thought in mindJust to make it till the morningLooking for what they can findFor a man they won't rememberFor a night they can't forgetDo you come to this place often?May I light your cigarette?Drinkin' beer in AmarilloPassing time and swaping jokesHoping for a new beginningBut beginning to lose hopeAnd you're waiting for that momentWhen a glance becomes a stareMmm, what's that perfume that you're wearing?Haven't I met you somewhere? Find a matchbook in the morningWith a name and number scrawledWhen you phone, a woman answersAnd you wish you'd never calledOh, they're friendly when they meet youBut they're strangers when they goAhh, do you mind if I come join you?Would you like to dance one more? And it's gettin' near to closingAnd the seconds pass like yearsLots of friends to share the laughterNot a one to share the tears Oh and you wish they'd change that juke boxCause you know every song it playsCan I drop you off at my place?Oh, what's the matter, are you gay?You gotta twenty in your pocketGot your toothbrush in your purseLife could get a whole lot betterBut it better not get worse Single bars and single womenWith a single thought in mindJust to make it till the morningLooking for what they can find

You jark back your hand away from mineAnd I move my lips away from yoursThen quietly we sit trying to forgetThose deep running thoughts that run wild across our mindsYou quickly stop the words you start to sayAnd we realize just how close we areAnd we both know if we let ourselves goWe'll do something we'll be sorry forSlip away today means sorrow tomorrowIt's love we know but we can't keep but yet we like to borrowTrying to hold back emotions and desiresIt's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for[ ac.guitar ]My love hungry heart begs for moreOf what your lips hold in storeBut our conscience just won't let us at least tonight it kept usFrom jumping off the deep end and going too farBut one of these nights you and IWill be ruled by the passion of our heartsAnd we both know that we let ourselves goAnd do something that we'll be sorry forSlip away today means sorrow tomorrow...It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for
Sweet little cherry blossom, blooming before her timeMoving her lips to her favorite song, cherishing every rhymeSwaying her hips to the rhythm, humming along with the tuneLost in her own little dream world, slow dancin' with the moonWatching her, I cannot help but go back in my mindAnd suddenly I find, I am 15 againSlow dancing with the moonOh, the stars got in my eyes long time agoAnd I've lived my life like a love sick clown in a bittersweet cartoonJust a dreamy-eyed kid slow dancin' with the moonWatching the girl I'm reminded, she's quite a lot like meTrapped in the suburbs of wonderland, lost in her own fantasySomehow my heart never grew up, no one ever burst my balloonSo here I am swirling in star dust, slow dancin' with the moonStill believe someday my wildest dreams will all come trueAnd I'll find someone who'll make me 15 againBut until then I'm slow dancin' with the moonOh, the stars got in my eyes, long time agoAnd I've lived my life like a love sick clown in a bittersweet cartoonJust a dreamy-eyed kid, slow dancin' with the moonStill a starry-eyed kid, slow dancin' with the moon
When I left, I left walkin' woundedI made my escape from the rainStill a prisoner of hurtI had months worth of workJust freein' my mind of the painI had hours of sittin' alone in the darkListenin' to sad songs and comin' apartLord knows I made crying an artWoe is a slow healing heartA slow healing heart dyin' to mendLongin' for love, lonely againWhen the spirit is brokenAnd the memories startNothin' moves slowerThan a slow healing heartHow I prayed for blind faith to lead meTo places where I'm not afraidNow I'm doin' fine both in body and mindSome hurts take longer to fadeBut there's a part of my feelings ever on guardAgainst looks that are tender and words that are hard'Cause I still remember those cutting remarksOh, it's painful a slow healing heartA slow healing heart dyin' to mendLongin' for love, lonely againWhen the spirit is brokenAnd the memories startYou know nothin' moves slowerThan a slow healing heartOh, nothin' moves slowerThan a slow healing heart
You ought to go north somebody told usCause the air is filled with gold dustAnd fortune falls like snow flakes in your handsNow I don't recall who said itBut we'd lived so long on creditAnd so we headed out to find our promised landJust poor Smoky Mountains farm folkWith nothing more than high hopesSo we hitched our station wagon to a starBut our dreams all fell in on usCause there was no land of promiseThough it's a stuggle just keepin' sight of who you areOh and these northern nights are drearyAnd my southern heart is wearyAs I wonder how the old folks are back homeBut I know that they all love meAnd they're all thinking of meThe Smoky Mountains memories keep me strongYou know I've been thinkin' a whole lot latelyAbout what's been and what awaits meIt takes all I've got to give what life demandsYou go insane if you give in to itLife's a mill and I've been through itI'm just thankful I'm creative with my handsOh and these northern nights they're drearyAnd my southern eyes are tearyAs I wonder how the old folks are back homeBut I'll keep leanin' on my JesusHe'll love and guide and lead usThe Smoky Mountains memories keep me strongIf I'll keep looking to the fatherKeep our heads above the waterWhile the Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong

Momma moved out Daddy sold the house They split up the money And went on their way And all the king's horses And all the king's men Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again Starting over again Where should they begin Cause they've never been out on their own Starting over again Where do you begin When your dreams are all shattered And the kids are all grown And the whole world cries Got an apartment She moved in with her sisters He's scheming big deals with one of his friends While she sits at home Just sorting out pieces Of left over memories From thirty odd years Starting over again Where do you begin You've never been out on your own Starting over again Never any end What will the neighbors say? They're talking talk, its small town news Facing fifty years old Making up a happy home And this far down the road You find yourself alone Two fools Starting over again Now where do you begin When you've never been out on your own Starting over again Never any end When your dreams are all shattered And the kids are all grown And all the king's horses And all the king's men Could never put mommy and daddy back together Back together, again

The bridge, so highThe bridge, so tallHere is where it startedOn the bridgeThe moon is big and yellowAnd the stars are all a' glowFrom the bridge, I see reflectionsIn the waters far below You kissed me for the first time hereAn' held me awfully tightAnd the bridge became our favorite placeWe came here often in the night And one night while standing on the bridgeDesire swept through us bothPassion took us by the handAnd showed us where to go From the bridge we saw a meadowSo we ran together thereWhere we found love togetherOur emotions filled the air The bridge, so wideThe bridge, so longWhere once we stood togetherTonight I stand alone Tonight, while standing on the bridgeMy heart is beating wildTo think that you could leave me hereWith our unborn child My feet are moving slowlyCloser to the edgeHere is where it startedAnd here is where I'll end it...
You come to me with teardrops in your eyesExpecting me to listen to your liesYou want me to forget and to forgiveEnough, enough, this ain't no way to live I know you wonder why I'd leave like thisAfter all the hurt I've put up withThis is the last time, this is the last strawToo late, too late now it's your time to crawl She's just the straw that broke the camel's heartIt's not her fault, it's yours we fell apartNo more, I'm done, I want a brand new startShe's just the straw that broke the camel's heart I've been grasping at straws for much too longThis ain't the first time you have done me wrongThis time you drew the short end of the strawThe game is over, you have lost it all She's just the straw that broke the camel's heartIt's not her fault, it's yours we fell apartNo more, I'm done, I want a brand new startIt's just the straw that broke the camel's heart She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart

The fishermanAre pitching penniesIn the sandBeside the seaThe sunrise hitsTheir oilskin bootsAnd their painted boatsAnd meThey seemTo know the oceanLike a manKnows a womanShe makes himWait aroundFor half the morningFor the tide to turn Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fishermanNever catches moreThan he knowsHe can sell in a dayPull on the ropes, Seine haul fishermanDay's for workNight's the timeTo go dancing They're drinking beerAnd laughingAnd squinting at the sunWaiting for the gullsTo tell themWhen the fish will comeTheir faces brownAnd weatheredFrom all the netsThey've runThey've learned to waitThey always knowThat the tide will turn Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fishermanNever catches moreThan he knowsHe can sell in a day; Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fishermanDay's for work.Night's the timeTo go dancing Way out on the oceanThe big shipsHunt for whalesThe JapaneseHave caught so manyThat nowThey hunt for snailsMy fisherman's not greedyHe seems content to liveWith the sun and the sandAnd a net full of fishWhen the tide turns Pull on the ropesSeine haul fishermanNever catchesMore than he knowsHe can sell in a dayPull on the ropesSeine haul fishermanDay's for workNight's the timeTo go dancing Pull on the ropesSeine haul fishermanNever catchesMore than he knowsHe can sell in a dayPull on the ropesSeine haul fishermanDay's for workNight's the timeTo go dancing

(Dolly Parton)I don't know why I like him, I just only know I do I don't know why I trust him, I just know his heart is true I don't know why he's more a man than any man I know I don't know how I know the man's for real but I still know The man is more than what meets the eye He is worn and weary from life He is rugged but he's got style The man has got what matters inside Weary, yes he must get weary but he doesn't say But you can read between the lines that wind along his face The man has got his memories that he hides inside his mind And you can see the sadness in the eyes they hide behind The man is more than what meets the eye He is worn and weary from life He is rugged but he's got style The man has got what matters inside Love him, yes I've always loved him and I always will He holds a place in my heart no one else could ever fill He's always been my hero, the best friend I've ever had The man is something special and I'm proud that he's my dad The man is more than what meets the eye He is worn and weary from life He is rugged but he's got style The man has got what matters inside
Oh the monkey's had a better tale than youCompare to yours all their tales sound so trueThe way you're actin' seems to me at all the monkey should go freeYou're the one that should be locked up in the ZooWhen I married you I thought you were a manBut you're the biggest ape that's living in this landI'd like to run you up a tree for the way you lie to meYour swingin' round is gettin' out of handOh the monkey's had...Every monkey has its day so go ahead and playMake your plans and tell your lies and stick to themBut from now on I remind you can wag your tail behind youCause you finally got yourself out on a limb[ banjo ]Every monkey has its day...Oh the monkey's had a better tale than you

(Porter Wagoner)There are so many things that I don't understand And I search my mind to try to find an answer But the more I search the less I seem to find out why Like where where the wind goes, how does life begin What happens when we die The mystery of the mystery must stay unknown Only God can know and man must not see Great minds have tried but they will not find The answer to the mystery of the mystery Man will seek the mystic rails of the mystery But their silent halls reveal not a sound Many men will give their lives just to try to find The answer to a mystery in their mind The mystery of the mystery must stay unknown Only God can know and man must not see Great minds have tried but they will not find The answer to the mystery of the mystery 
The only way out is to walk over meSo you found someone else and you're going to leaveDid she tell you I don't love you did you really believeOn the floor by the door I'll be down on my kneesCause the only way out is to walk over meYou don't hear and you don't feel but I know you can seeJust to prove that I love you I'll crawl at your feetJust look down at the ground where your footprints will beCause the only way out is to walk over meYou have put me just as low as anyone ought to goBut I lay down beside what's left of my prideIf you go then you'll know cause you can't help but seeThat the only way out is to walk over meYou have put me just as low...Yes the only way out is to walk over me
(Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner)Oh, the pain of loving you Oh, the misery I go through Never knowing what to do Oh, the pain of loving you You just can't stand to see me happy Seems you hurt me all you can Still I go on loving you But I never understand To love and hate at the same time The line between the two is fine The two have bound me heart and soul So strong that I can't let you go To love and hate at the same time The line between the two is fine The two have bound me heart and soul So strong that I can't let you go
As we were dressing to go out our little girl and boyCame in and asked if they could go this timeWe told them little girls and boys don't belong at partiesAnd that they should be in bed asleep by nineThe babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbyeAnd told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cryThen we left for the party like we'd so often doneThinkin' only of ourselves and not our little onesThe party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore onWith drinking laughing teling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of homeThen the stranger feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bonesAnd I told my wife that we'd better leave the partyCause I felt that we were needed at homeAs we rode along I got to thinking of how the kids that mornin'Had asked if we would take them to church the next dayAnd how I'd put 'em off like I'd so often doneBy sayin' we'd probably get home too lateThen my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirensAs they cut through the still night airThen we turned down our street that's when we saw the fireThe rest was like a nightmare We took their little bodies to church the next dayThough we'd left the party early we still got home too late

Well, I've sacrificed time with family and friendsGave up vacations for work without endTwenty four seven, three hundred and sixty fiveBut I was willing to make the sacrificeBut empty or full, I've carried my pailYou don't drink the water if you don't dig the wellThrough blood sweat and tears I have built a good lifeBut it didn't come without sacrificeBut I was gonna be rich no matter how much it costAnd I was gonna win no matter how much I lostAll through the years I kept my eye on the prizeYou ask if it's worth the sacrifice, the sacrificeI think about Jesus and all that he gaveAnd the ultimate sacrifice that he madeHe is my strength and my guiding lightAnd he's taught me that nothing's without sacrificeI was gonna be rich no matter how much it costAnd I was gonna win no matter how much I lostI wanted success and, brother, I've paid the priceAnd, yes, it's been worth the sacrifice, the sacrificeI was gonna be rich no matter how much it costAnd I was gonna win no matter how much I lostGrindstones and rhinestones have made up my lifeBut I've shined like a diamond through sacrificeI was gonna be rich no matter how much it costAnd I was gonna win no matter how much I lostBut I hope God will tell me, 'Well done, my childYou've won your reward through your sacrifice, the sacrifice'The sacrificeBut sometimes I wonder in the still of the nightIs it really worth the sacrificeI've often laughed and I've often criedI've often failed but I've always triedI made the sacrificeThe sacrifice
(Dolly Parton)I've tried and I've tried for so long to please you Gave you every bit of my time Gave you everything I could possibly give you My body, my heart, and my mind I turned my family and good friends against me Listened to my own heart break And I did it all in the name of love Gave up myself for your sake And you never cared about me You only hurt and deceive I realize after all of these years That you ain't worth the salt in my tears You've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me Over and over again You promised to love me forever But forever reached a bitter sweet end Been blinded by love to your actions But at last I can see my way clear I've cried and I've tried, and I've tried and I've cried But you, you've never shed one tear 'Cause you never cared about me You only hurt and deceive I realize after all of these years That you ain't worth the salt in my tears You ain't worth, you ain't worth the salt in my tears Treated like dirt, I'm hurt, I ain't hangin' 'round here You've left me crying, left me crying for years But you ain't worth the salt in my tears You never cared about me You only hurt and decieve I realize after all of these years That you ain't worth the salt in my tears No you ain't worth the salt in my tears
(Dolly Parton)I am a seekerA poor sinful creatureThere is no weaker than I amI am a seekerYou are a teacherYou are a reacherSo reach downWon't you reach out and lead meGuide me and keep meIn the shelter of your care each day'Cause I am a seekerYou are a keeperYou are the leaderWon't you show me the wayI am a vessel that's empty and uselessI am a bad seed that fell by the wayI am a loser that wants to be a winnerAnd you are my last hopeDon't turn me awayI am a seekerA poor sinful creatureThere is no weaker than I amI am a seekerYou are a teacherYou are a reacherSo reach downWon't you reach out and lead meGuide me and keep me, LordIn the shelter of your care each day'Cause I am a seekerYou are a keeperYou are the leaderWon't you show me the wayOh, I know you are a mountainFrom which there flows a fountainSo let it's water wash my sins away'Cause I am a seekerYou are a keeperYou are the leaderWon't you show me the way
Oh, say can you see,By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars, Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched, Were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
Now, people say I'm the life of the party'Cause I'll tell a joke or two.Although I might be laughin' loud and hearty,Deep down inside I'm blue.[Chorus]So take a good look at my faceYou'll see my smile looks out of place.If you'll look closer,It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.I need you, need you.But since you left me if you see me with another guy,Seemin' like I'm havin' fun.He might look good it's trueBut he's a substitute 'cause you were the perfect one.[Chorus]I need you, I need you.Outside I'm masqueradin','Cause inside my hope is fading.Like a clown since you put me down,And my smile is my makeup I wear since my break up with you.[Chorus: x2]

(Porter Wagoner)You're gentle body lying here so close to me As you move your hand slowly across my face You're touch is as soft as the words you speak to me What a love in the way I see you I compare it with the beauty of the dawning Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty Like the love in the way I see you I compare it with the beauty of the dawning Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty What a love in the way I see you

I saw him picking up the pieces of his broken heart And so I stopped to see what I could do His heart had been run over by a reckless lover She ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue Tears were scattered everywhere he was trying to save his pride He was the victim of a love and run And I could plainly see that she had almost killed him Left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him I'll take his heart and mend it if I can Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him I'll take his tears and dry them as fast as he can cry them I'll heal his hurt and make him as good as new again
Those memories of you still haunt meEvery night when I lay downI'll always love you, little darlingUntil the day they lay me down In dreams of you, my body tremblesI wake up and call your nameBut you're not there, and I'm so lonesomeWithout your love I'd go insane Those memories of you still haunt meEvery night when I lay downI'll always love you, little darlingUntil the day they lay me down I close my eyes and you're there with meYour kiss I feel, your face I seeIt's not your lips now that drive me crazyIt's just your haunting memory Those memories of you still haunt meEvery night when I lay downI'll always love you, my little darlingUntil the day they lay me downUntil the day they lay me down
Once upon a time there was a tavernWhere we used to raise a glass or twoRemember how we laughed away the hoursAnd dreamed of all the great things we would do[Chorus]Those were the days my friendWe thought they'd never endWe'd sing and dance forever and a dayWe'd live the life we chooseWe'd fight and never loseFor we were young and sure to have our way.La la la la,Those were the days, oh yes those were the daysThen the busy years went rushing by usWe lost our starry notions on the wayIf by chance I'd see you in the tavernWe'd smile at one another and we'd say[Chorus]Just tonight I stood before the tavernNothing seemed the way it used to beIn the glass I saw a strange reflectionWas that lonely woman really me[Chorus]Through the door there came familiar laughterI saw your face and heard you call my nameOh my friend we're older but no wiserFor in our hearts the dreams are still the same[Chorus]

[Spoken:]Today you told me that you'd found anotherAnd you took off your golden wedding bandThe one you vowed you'd wear until death do us partWhen I kissed it and placed it on your handA wreath will hang upon the door tomorrowOf the little house that we once called our homeAnd friends will stop and hang their heads in sorrowTo pay the last respects to one gone on Tonight I lay me down to sleep foreverWith this small empty bottle and broken heartI keep the vow I made I won't forsake itI promised to death do us part Will you bring your new love to the chapelTo look upon the one that you betrayedWill you bring me pretty flowers like you used toAnd replace them in my hands where I lay Will you cry and think of happy mem'riesThat we shared together at the startAnd will you look upon me and rememberthe day we said till death do us part
I didn't cry all of these tears just to have you show up here againI didn't lie awake all these nights to have you come walking back inI didn't change my whole life around, not to mention my dreams and my plansTo have you come back with your same ol' act thinking that I'll understand Time and tears have mended the painHealed all the hurt and changed everythingTime and tears I'm happy to sayTime and tears have washed it awayTime and tears have washed you away I didn't think that I would survive the day that you walked out on meI truly was more dead than alive
I've been around for you, been up and down for youBut I just can't get any reliefI swallowed my pride for you, I've lived and lied for youBut you still make me feel like a thiefYou've got me stealing your love away, 'cause you never give itPeeling the years away, we can't relive itI make you laugh and you make me cry, I believe it's time for me to flyTime for me to fly, got to set myself freeThat's how it's got to beI know it hurts to say goodbyeBut it's time for me to flyYou said we'd work it out, you said that you had no doubtI thought we were really in loveOh but I'm tired of holding on to a feeling I know is goneI do believe I've had enoughI've had enough of the falseness of a worn out relationEnough of this jealousy and intolerationI wonder why I even try, I believe it's time for me to flyTime for me to fly, I've got to set myself freeThat's just how it's got to beI know it hurts to say goodbyeBut it's time for me to fly, time for me to flyTime for me to fly, I've got to set myself freeThat's just how it's got to beI make you laugh and you make me cryI believe it's time for me to flyTime for me to flyThat's how it's got to beI know it hurts to say goodbyeBut it's time for me to fly

No matter how you're tempted Don't say yes to me Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone I've been too lonely too long Oh please be strong enough to refuse me Before I let myself do something wrong For down inside I'm not that kind of woman I've been too lonely too long Oh please don't take advantage of the situation For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation When you're used to being loved It's hard to live alone I've been too lonely too long I've been too lonely too long

Well I can't tell you where I'm going, I'm not sure of where I've been But I know I must keep travelin' till my road comes to an end I'm out here on my journey, trying to make the most of it I'm a puzzle, I must figure out where all my pieces fit Like a poor wayfaring stranger that they speak about in song I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find what feels like home Where that is no one can tell me, am I doomed to ever roam I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' on Questions I have many, answers but a few But we're here to learn, the spirit burns, to know the greater truth We've all been crucified and they nailed Jesus to the tree And when I'm born again, you're gonna see a change in me God made me for a reason and nothing is in vain Redemption comes in many shapes with many kinds of pain Oh sweet Jesus if you're listening, keep me ever close to you As I'm stumblin', tumblin', wonderin', as I'm travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Oh sometimes the road is rugged, and it's hard to travel on But holdin' to each other, we don't have to walk alone When everything is broken, we can mend it if we try We can make a world of difference, if we want to we can fly Goodbye little children, goodnight you handsome men Farewell to all you ladies and to all who knew me when And I hope I'll see you down the road, you meant more than I knew As I was travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' Drifting like a floating boat and roaming like the wind Oh give me some direction lord, let me lean on you As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Like the poor wayfaring stranger that they speak about in song I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find my own way home Oh sweet Jesus if you're out there, keep me ever close to you As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', as I'm travelin' thru
The man I loved ran a salesman routeSelling goods from house to houseNow I knew my mama would never standFor me stepping out with no traveling manMama bought things that he was a'sellingBut mama didn't know and I sure wasn't tellingThat behind her back I was making plansTo meet somewhere with that traveling manOh the traveling man was a good bit olderBut a girl needs arms to hold herMama didn't know 'cause I didn't told herBut mama wouldn't understandMe stepping out with a traveling man Mama didn't allow me a'going courtingAnd I'd tell lies that I reckon I oughtn'tOh but she'd a'give me the back a' her handIf she'd a'seen me with that traveling manSo I tell my mama that I reckon I oughtaGo to the spring and fetch us some waterWhat mama didn't know is I had a planTo meet down there with that traveling man Now I make plans to run awayWith that traveling man on a SaturdayWell Saturday's here and here I standAnd there goes my mama with that traveling man Oh that traveling man was a two-time loverHe took my love then he took my motherBut I didn't know 'cause mama didn't told me and I don't understandMy mama running off with my traveling man Mama, you know you oughtn't a'done thatYou just like my daddyHe run off before I ever knowed himYou done run-off with my traveling manAnd I really don't think I ever knowed you eitherOh there goes my mama with my traveling manAnd I'm really gonna miss that traveling manMm-hm

Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party.And two doors down they're not aware that I'm around.Here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry.But they're having a party just two doors down.I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together.I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around.Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever.I think I'd really rather join 'em two doors down.Two doors down we're laughing and drinking and having a party.And two doors down they're all aware that I'm around.Here I am no longer crying and feeling sorry.We're having a party just two doors down.I can't believe I'm standing here dry-eyed, all smiles & talkin.'Making conversation with the new love I've found.I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin.'Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down.[Chorus]Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party.And two doors down we're not aware that they're around.Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry.We're having our own party two doors down.Oh oh oh two doors down.Oh oh oh two doors down.Oh oh oh two doors down.Oh oh oh two doors down.[Chorus: x 2]
Two little children a boy and a girlSat by an old church doorThe little girl's feet Were as brown as the curlThat fell on the dress that she woreThe little boy's cloths were all tattered and tornThey shown beneath his blue eyesWhy don't you go home To you mommy I saidAnd this was the maddens replyMommy's in heaven Angels took her awayLeft Tim and I all aloneWe've no one to love usAnd daddy is deadAnd our darling mother is goneMommy got sick Angels took her away To dwell in those mansions so brightShe said she would come For her children some dayAnd I guess she's coming tonightThe sexton came early To ring the church bellAnd found them Beneath the snow whiteThe angels made room for the orphans to dwellUp in heaven with their mommy that night

I can't live with you when you try to own meThough you may give me love like I have never knownBut if you try to control me then you won't never know meAnd I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strongSo love me just for what I am don't try to change a thingAnd I'll take you just like you are and I'll expect the sameSo if you want to love me you must understand all of meFor I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strongAnd I have no control over what I feel insideAnd I can't change the way I am and you must be satisfiedSo if you think you can't be without place and chance on meThen I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong[ ac.guitar ]I have no control...I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
When you love somebody with all your heart and soul And you want to keep them with youBut you know they want to go What do you doWhat do you say When you know they want to leave As bad as you want them to stay And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much It's a sad situation, I must say When you know they want to leave As bad as you want them to stay You know how much I love you But I know you don't love me And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave But I do, I stand aside and just let you walk away But I know you want to leave As bad as I want you to stay And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love When one doesn't love at all and the other loves too much It's a sad situation, I must say When someone wants to leaveAs bad as you want them to stay Oh, it's a sad situation I must say When someone wants to leaveAs bad as you want them to stay
(Dolly Parton)Thumbing for a ride by the edge of the road With a brown paper bag to hold my clothes But tonight I'm going home where I belong If the good lord's willing and the creek don't rise And if my luck holds out, and I catch me a ride When the sun goes down tomorrow, I should be home This big city ain't no kind of place For a country girl with a friendly face If you smile people look at your funny, they take it wrong They laugh at my talkin' and clothes I wear They put me down and they call me square But tonight I'm going home where I belong I'm goin' back to the people I love Back to the place that I dream of It's true that there's no place like home sweet home The one I want to see the most Is the boy who begged me not to go When the sun goes down tomorrow Tonight I'm going back where I belong 

I want to feel this wayLonger than timeI want to know your dreamsAnd make them mineI want to change the worldOnly for youAll the impossibleI want to doI want to hold you close under the rainI want to kiss your smileAnd feel your painI know what's beautifulLooking at youHere in a world of liesYou are the true[Chorus:]And babyEverytime you touch meI become a heroI'll make you safe no matter where you areAnd bring youAnything you ask forNothing is above meI'm shining like a candle in the darkWhen you tell me that you love meI want to make you seeJust what i wasShow you the lonelinessAnd what it doesYou walked into my lifeTo stop my tearsEverything's easy nowI have you here[Repeat chorus]In a world without youI would always hungerAll i need is your love to make me stronger[Repeat chorus]
Whenever forever comes, when darkness shall hide the sunI'll still be shining with love for youWhen glory bells chime, my love will ring trueHeaven and earth shall pass away but my love will be yours always.Whenever forever comes when all things are said and doneI'll still be feeling the same way I doI'll be there for you, and still wanting youGod gave you to me, and me to youAnd you will still be the one whenever forever comes.We'll float on a cloud through eternityYou'll gather the stars, you'll give them to meI'll give you the moon, and we'll replace the sunWhenever forever comes, whenever forever comes.What would I have ever done had I not had you to love?You've given me more than I ever dreamedLoving you more every day, so it seemsGreater than all other loves I have seenIts essence will linger on whenever forever comes.
(Dolly Parton)She stands before the mirror Smiles at her reflection Striking sexy poses in the glass She paints her lips a brilliant red Piles her hair high on her head Struggles to replace a false eyelash She powders up her face Paints her cheeks to match her lips She wears a dress cut low in the front Fittin' tight around her hips And there inside her room She stands and gazes at herself Where beauty lives in memory She lives in fairy tales Mirror, mirror on the wall Who's the fairest of them all She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor She keeps a candle burning And she waits for his returning When beauty lives in memory It lives forevermore She was a fairy princess once And was by all adored They say she was the fairest of them all They called her Cinderella And they say that every fella Would gladly answer to her beck and call So the story went They tell of how this handsome prince Stole her heart and wandered far away He took her heart and took her mind Now she has lost all track of time Forty years has passed and still she waits singing Mirror, mirror on the wall Who's the fairest of them all She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor She keeps a candle burning And she waits for his returning When beauty lives in memory It lives forevermoreMeanwhile back inside her room The shads are pulled it's half past noon But in her mind why it's forty years ago She recalls the beauty of their love She remembers he was beautiful And of course she always knew she was And so the past unfolds And all at once inside her mind She sees him at the door And as he's leading her away She feels the room begin to sway Where beauty lives in memory She falls dead upon the floor Mirror, mirror on the wall Who's the fairest of them all She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor She keeps a candle burning And she waits for his returning When beauty lives in memory It lives forevermore

In a shingle covered cottage at the foothills of blue stacks Near a mountain stream that's flowing crystal clear Where the humming birds and honey bees feed on Mama's roses My mem'ries just grow sweeter with the years Mem'ries of my childhood are as sweet as mountain honey And as fresh as a dew on morning glory vines I grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature And they're forever present in my mind But I'm headed in the wrong direction home Headed in the wrong direction home There's no place like home But I'm headed in the wrong direction home Teardrops mingled with the summer rain that was a falling The day I left my mountain home behind With a suitcase in my hand and a hope in my heart I was following a dream I had to find In that shingled covered cottage at the foothills of the smokies Waits a family hat I'm longing to see And mountain streams and fields of green And rolling hills stay in my dreams But I'm many, many miles from Tennessee And still headed in the wrong direction home Headed in the wrong direction home But maybe I'll get back before too long But I'm headed in the wrong direction home

Oh you said you were my baby Now I know that you're my baby But it seems to be you got roamin' eyes If you wanna be my baby Then you gotta be my baby You can't keep your finger in two different lives I remember how you pleaded When my love you said you needed And I believe without a doubt So if you wanna be my baby Then you gotta be my baby And keep those kissin' cousins out Oh you know how when I said I was a'rollin' low? I get suspicious and I'm a'gonna tell you so If you wanna be my baby Then you gotta be my baby And be nobody's baby but mine Just think about it Now I heard there was another So I went and asked your mother If anybody hung around besides me She gave me no satisfaction And now I can't take no action But I think I'll hang around and see If you wanna be my baby Then you gotta be my baby You gotta come to me and tell me so If you wanna be my baby Then you gotta be my baby I'm tired of waitin' around so let them know Oh how when I said that I'm a Rollin low I'm gunna get suspicious and I'm gunna tell you so If you wanna be my baby Then you gotta be my baby And be nobody's baby but mine I said and be nobody's baby but mine And I mean it!

You were not content with me when I was like I used to beI was too old fashion too simple and too plainAnd so you took this country girl taught me all about the worldYes you're the one that taught me how to swingI used to never drink or smoke I'd even blushed your dirty jokesI never wanted to take part in all those wordly gamesBut you dressed me up in sexy clothes took me where the swingers goYes you're the one that taught me how to swingBut you don't want me swingin' now but you're the one that taught me howIt was you that wanted me to changeI'm only what you've made of me your mistake was changin' meYes you're the one that taught me how to swing You want me like I was before but I'm not like that anymoreThis plain old simple country girl won't never be the sameSo don't expect me to go back cause it's a bit too late to backAnd you're the one that taught me how to swingBut you don't want me swingin' now...Yes you're the one that taught me how to swing taught me how to swing
