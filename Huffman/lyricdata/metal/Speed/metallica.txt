For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know Stiffened wounds test there their pride Men of five, still alive through the raging glowGone insane from the pain that they surely know For whom the bell tolls Time marches on For whom the bell tollsTake a look to the sky just before you die It is the last time you will Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery He hears the silence so loud Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to seeFor whom the bell tolls Time marches on For whom the bell tolls

Mama, they try and break me. The window burns to light the way back home A light that warms no matter where they've gone. They're off to find the hero of the day But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way? Still the window burns, time so slowly turns Someone there is sighing Keepers of the flames Do you feel your names? Do you hear your babies crying? Mama they try and break me Still they try and break me 'Scuse me while I tend to how I feel These things return to me that still seem real Now deservingly this easy chair But the rocking stops by wheels of despair Don't want your aid But the fist I've made for years won't hold or feel No I'm not all me So please excuse me while I tend to how I fell But now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night (echoed between James and Jason) So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until it's light Can you hear your babies crying now? Still the window burns Time so slowly turns And someone there is sighing Keepers of the flames, can't you feel your names? Can't you hear your babies crying?

Open doors so I walk inside Close my eyes find my place to hide And I shake as I take it in Let the show begin Open my eyes Just to have them close again Well on my way On my way to where I graze It swallows me As it takes me in his home I twist away As I kill this world Open doors so I walk inside Close my eyes find my place to hide And I shake as I take it in Let the show begin Open my eyes Just to have them close once again Don't want control As It takes me down and down again Is that the moon Or just a light that lights this dead end street? Is that you there Or just another demon that I meet?

The cerebrum has suffered massive and reparable damageYou never know what has happened to himIf I have not been sure of this, I would not have permitted him to liveWhere am I? Father, what happened? I need help What is democracy? What is democracy?It got something to do with young men killing each other, ArthurWhat if its my turn, will you want me to go?For democracy, any man would give his only begotten son It is impossible for any severed individual to experience painPleasure, memory, dream or thought of any kindThis young man will be as unfeeling as unthinking as the deadUntil the day joins them I don't know weather I'm alive or dreaming or dead or rememberingHow can you tell what's a dream and what's realWhen you can't even tell when your awake and when your asleepWhere am I? I cant remember anythingCan't tell if this is true or dreamDeep down inside I feel to screamThis terrible silence stops with me Now that the war is through with meI'm waking up, I cannot seeThat there's not much left of meNothing is real but pain now Hold my breath as I wish for deathOh, please God, wake me They kept my head and chopped off everythingOh, God, please make them hear meThey won't listen, they wont hear meThey got to wake me up Ill be like this for years, hear me Back in the womb it's much too realIn pumps life that I must feelBut can't look forward to revealLook to the time when I'll live Fed through the tube that sticks in meJust like a wartime noveltyTied to machines that make me beCut this life off from me Hold my breath as I wish for deathOh, please God, wake meIt's like a piece of me

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mindPeople think I'm insane because I am Frowning all the time All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfyThink I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify Can you help me?Occupy my brain?Oh yeah I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't findI can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cryHappiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal And so as you hear these words telling you now of my stateI tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

Unchain the colours before my eyes,Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,I shall return from out of fire.Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,Flickers above us, to light up the sky.Unchain the colours before my eyes,Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,I shall return from out of fire
Guilty as charged But damn it, it ain't right There is someone else controlling me Death in the air Strapped in the electric chair This can't be happening to me Who made you God to say "I'll take your life from you!" Flash before my eyes Now it's time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames Wait for the sign To flick the switch of death It's the beginning of the end Sweat, chilling cold As I watch death unfold Consciousness my only friend My fingers grip with fear What I am doing here? Flash before my eyes Now it's time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames Someone help me Oh please God help me They are trying to take it all away I don't want to die Time moving slowly The minutes seem like hours The final curtain call I see How true is this? Just get it over with If this is true, just let it be Wakened by the horrid cream Freed from the frightening dream Flash before my eyes Now it's time to die Burning in my brain I can feel the flames

Like a siren in my head that I was placed to repeatLike a blind man that was shoved into the speeding driver's seatLike a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to fightLike a misery that keeps me from just going out astrayLike an illness that I'm about to waken from its stateContradictionA premonitionNow are the aids who I denyI denyI blind my eyes and try to force it all into placeI stitch them up, see not my fall from graceI blind my eyes, I hardly feel it passing me byI open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your lifeAlmost like your endless fightCursed, the day is longRealize you don't belongDisconnect somehowNever stop complaining nowAlmost like your fightAnd there it wentAlmost like your lifeLike a bullet, keeps on bleeding to remind me not to thinkLike a raging river, drowning when I only need a drinkLike a poison that I swallow, but I want the world to dieLike a release from a prison that I didn't know I was inLike a fight to live the present, I pictured it like thisLike a general without a mission until the wars start againStart againI blind my eyes and try and force it all into placeI stitch them up, see not my fall from graceI blind my eyes, I hardly feel it passing me byI open just in time to say goodbyeAlmost like your lifeAlmost like your endless fightCursed, the day is longRealize you don't belongDisconnect somehowNever stop complaining nowAlmost like your fightAnd there it wentAlmost like your lifeLike a touch from hellI feel how hot that it can get if you get caughtLike a strike from heaven that turns that keyThat brings you straight down to your kneesLike a touch from hellI feel how hot that it can get if I get caughtLike a strike from heaven to reprieveThat brings you straight down to your kneesAlmost like your lifeAlmost like your endless fightCursed, the day is longRealize you don't belongDisconnect somehowNever stop complaining nowAlmost like your fightAnd there it wentAlmost like your lifeThat was just your life

The Chase is Better Than the Catch  (Metallica - Miscellaneous)    You know I'm bad, the times I've had  I've gotta bad reputation  I don't care, I get my share  Don't feel no deprivation  The more I get the better it is  I like it fine, Like a little whizz  Treat'em like ladies, that's a fact  You know the chase is better than the catch   Silver tongued devil, deamon leach  You know just what I'm doing  I like a little innocent bitch  You know I ain't just screwing  I love you baby, love you too much  I like you fine I feel your touch  But your appearance don't hold no class  You know the chase is better than the catch   A little beauty I love you madly  Come on home with me  I know you're hot, I know what you've got  You know I want to shake your tree  Come on honey touch me right there  Come on honey don't you get scared  come on honey let me get you in the sack  You know the chase is better than the catch
Born to push you aroundBetter just stay downYou pull awayHe hits the fleshYou hit the groundMouth so full of liesTend to block, your eyesJust keep them closedKeep prayingJust keep awaitingWaiting for the oneThe day that never comesWhen they stand up and feel the warmthBut the sunshine never comes, noNo, the sunshine never comesPush you cross that lineJust stay down this timeHide in yourselfCrawl in yourselfYou'll have your timeGod I'll make them payTake it back one dayI'll end this dayI'll splatter color on this graveWaiting for the oneThe day that never comesWhen they stand up and feel the warmthBut the sunshine never comesLove is a four letter wordAnd never spoken hereLove is a four letter wordHere in this prisonI suffer this no longerI put it intoThis I swearThis I swearThe sun will shineThis I swearThis I swearThis I swear

As I was going over the Kilmagenny mountainI saw with captain Farrell and his money he was counting.I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier.I Said stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver, Kertos{je: musha ring dumma do damma da ( tai jotain )Whack for my daddy 'olWhack for my daddy 'olThere's whiskey in the jar I counted out his money, and it made a pretty penny.I put it in my pocket and I brought it home to Marley.She said and she swore, that she never would leave me,But the devil take the women, for they never can be easy Kertos{e, elikk{ Chorus I went into my chamber, for to take a slumber,I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder.But Jenny took my charges and she filled them up with water,And send for captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter. Chorus It was early in the morning, before I rose to travel,The guards were all around me and likewise captain Farrel.I first produced my pistol, for she stole away my rapier,But I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken. Chorus If anyone can aid me, it's my brother in the army,If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney.And if he'll come and save me, we'll go roving near Kilkenny,And I swear he'll treat me better than me darling sportling Jenny Chorus Now some men take delight in the drinking and the roving,But others take delight in the gambling and the smoking.But I take delight in the juice of the barley,And courting pretty Jenny in the morning bright and early Chorus
