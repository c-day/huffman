Worlds apart, separation from my mind.Just close my eyes to bring me there.I fall apart, the pieces are so hard to find.A puzzle piece is torn in half.The absence, of color, surrounds a broken dream.Call my eyes to take me thereOne by one I watch, as the pieces disappear,My friends become the ones I hate.This house of cards it, won't withstand the wind.I shut my eyes to escape.All my whites have turned to black.Every time I close my eyes, dream in Columbian.All my bugs are comin' back.Crawlin' on my face, they speak in!Columbian.Worlds apart, a separation from my soul.Worlds apart, the separation is now whole.I watch the pieces fall apart.I try to make a brand new start.I'm fallin' in, I'm fallin' out,I'm fallin' up, I'm fallin' back,I'm fallin' down, an' fallin' round, an' askin' why?

Critical moments pass,And doctrines of fools will last.I am just trying to cope,Into my horroscope.Through eyes and ears they bleed,Reciting their holy creed.Heeding but one request,The future, is put to, rest...Bless me in darkened days,Down to my knees I pray.I am just trying to cope,Within this horrorscope.In the wake of all frustration,I begin to loose control.Watched as the weapons fired,Bombs burst in the air...Burned in the fields of fire!Standing in the middle of nowhere.Watched as the weapons fired,Baptized in fields of fire!Well,The change in here, an' the future clear.I can feel it coming.So full of hate, its geting late!Yeah, I know its coming.When all the choice turned to just one voice,Yeah, the wind is turning.This is your horrorscope...Words laced with blasphemy,Drip with sincerity.Falling into the plan,Like sacrificial lambs.Hearing the words and said,Rings like nail, to the head.Now I can see the stars,I know we have gone too far.Baptized in fields of fire,Watched as the weapons fired.This is your horoscope

They came to the land, to kill on command.They ride through the dark of the night.Metal warrior stands over victims whose handsGrab for their last chance of life. Bright shields! sharp swords!March forward for their Lord.Set the bow, rulers comeMeet your maker.Battle cries! silent screams!Submerge the Devil in evil dreamsFeel the blade, rulers comeMeet your maker. I live for the kill, I do it at willLet the weak ride back to the lair.Now they will kneel to leather and steelGasp for the last breath of air. Blood runs! heads roll!Enemy fear, take the soulSet the bow, rulers comeMeet your maker.Lash out! strike first!Blood of the dead quench my thirstFeel the pain, rulers comeMeet your maker. A gilded warrior wonders why...His fear becomes new life on high...Looking down... the dead won't tell.Why his soul existence lives on in Hell.Long live the spirit...!In a life that knows no end...Many pass before him...Many in the wind.
A sense of peace was falling on the universal nightAnd it gave me a pause to reason why I liveTo never cease the calling of the consequential rightAnd it gave me cause and reason why they giveThe first thing I remember was the shadow 'cross my heartAnd they matched the beauty hidden in their soul The next was 'cross the universe, as it came apartAnd the sum of the parts became whole Stalking and hunting, profession in bloodWorking the night to a throneChalking an outline, experience mustInvisible, never alone I can take you anywhereTake all that you giveI can free you from despairKilling just to live Live to killKill to liveKilling for a living, killing just to live I looked across the answers, though questions didn't existAnd found that I was never aloneWe cut away the cancer and continued to resistBut the outcome of the night remained unknownThe next thing I remember were the years across my faceAnd they matched only the beauty of scarsThe next was 'cross the universe into time and spaceAnd to know together, we'd have to go too far Bleeding a nation, casualty timeBreaking the back of the corePromised salvation, a casual crimeFeeding and fucking the whoreMake my living on borrowed timeI make the clock stand stillKeep my hands 'round what is mineLiving just to killLive to killKill to live C'mon now kill a little kindness, give the worst of your bestC'mon now and shake a little madness, put the dead to restI can give you reasons, 2-5 to the boneThey can give you all you ever wantedWhen you're far away from homeC'mon now kill a little kindness, give the worst of your bestC'mon now and shake a little madness, put the dead to rest So as the plot will thicken and time is not a friendThe blessing comes but one in a lifeAcross the crowded universe that hastens to an endThrough memories of one time in a nightAnd what will I remember through the by and byTo have and hold and turn about the chillThat this was not the pause to dieBut to live to kill

I watch the smoke drift, from my cigarette.I hear the roaches cross the floor.Slam dance around me, in my chair I sit.The grey's leakin' through the door.There's a shade of grey! I've never seen beforeMy gaze fixed on, the space beneath the door.My life flash. before my eyesAll this sweat grew from one solitary dropGrey's movin' cross the floor.We walk alone, no one beside us!It's never simple as black or white.We should have known, no one would find us!That we would all wind up inShades of grey"It seems like every time I get a chance, is quite naked.And as I turn around, as I turn around, andInside there's no doubt its gonna happen again"Nobody listenin', so I talk to myself.Sometimes I pay me no, mindI lost this argument, so very long agoThe right words were so hard to findI can't breathe in the grey!An' I can't find the key to the door

[Originally performed by Judas Priest] You're in for surpriseYou're in for a shockIn London town streetsWhen there's darkness and fogWhen you least expect meAnd you turn your backI'll attack I smile when I'm sneakingThrough shadows by the wallI laugh when I'm creepingBut you won't hear me at all All hear my warningNever turn your backOn the ripper You'll soon shake with fearNever knowing if I'm nearI'm sly and I'm shamelessNocturnal and namelessExcept for "The Ripper"Or if you like "Jack The Knife" Any back alley streetIs where we'll probably meetUnderneath a gas lampWhere the air's cold and dampI'm a nasty surpriseI'm a devil in disguiseI'm a footstep at nightI'm a scream of the fright All hear my warningNever turn your backOn the ripper...the ripper....the ripper

Out on this road takes its tollAnd you pay for everything you doUnder lights, made me blindThis place is the same as last nightOut of control takes its tollBut you learn to live with your dreamsSpeaking your mind to those you findListening to what you have to sayI wouldn't change the wayI wouldn't stop the decayPromised the world, as your worldChanged before your eyesAnd the days became the weeksAnd the weeks the yearsAnd no one remembers that very first dayOr how it slipped awayForever I wait, pulling in, pulling outAs the motors whineTo remind me I'm homeAnd I'm here to stayAs we decayAnother dayDecay awayI'm goin' home, I don't know whereI'm goin' home, not far from hereOut on this road, paint this tollMake me whole, set the stageFill it with anger, fill it with rageNo I don't know what's todayI know it falls in the years of decaySelf, sacrifice, every nightAnd together we paid a price in bloodThat spilled out through the yearsAnd another day passes awayLook to the black, drawn farther backLook to each day, see the decayTimes I've had, good and badWin or lose, this is what I choose

Violent indecision, surge of mass religionLet me out of prisonI'm just killing timeEvery time I turn aroundI start to hear familiar soundCounting down as time stands stillYes I think it's time to killTime to killAll the mental anguishSpeaks a common languageI have yet to lavish a chance to walk awayEvery time I turn aroundI start to hear a familiar soundCounting down as time stands stillYes I think it's time to killUnknowing, unseeingRevelations unfold before your eyesRelenting, repenting.No time to think or compromiseTime falling, time callingInto a void and seal the pastYou're waiting, annihilating,Making it real, making it lastWorn out compromisesMust be out of risesSee through all the liesWe don't walk awayEvery time we turn aroundStart to hear that familiar soundNew beginnings time stands stillYes I think it's time to kill.
Sing me a song, you're a singer.Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil.The devil is only a maker,The less that you give, you're a taker. And it goes on and on and on.Heaven and Hell. The lover of life's not a sinner.The ending is just a beginner.The closer you get to the meaning,The sooner that you know you're dreaming.(2 again) (The Ripper - Judas Preist)In for a surprize, in...Well, we'll prob'ly meet,Underneath the gas lamp,Where the air's cold and damp.I'm a nasty...Never turn your back on the ripper.Awww...

Torn in disarray, Hear now what I say Brand your people, let them go Send them on their way Worn the fired plead, give them what they need Kill your people let them die Before they plant the seed Born, the black creation Sure, to never die In crimson sorrow rise, not to compromise No one knows where the cold wind blows Until it's in their eyes In guarded disbelief, the crimson turns to grief The loyalty you knew so well Now stuck between your teeth Born, in desolation Sure, to never die I am, God's creation I see the light of death Within your eyes Breath the devil's creation with a mouthful of flies I am the scourge of the nation Harbored within your eyes Never wore the crimson red Never thorns adorned the head When was what we used to be Now is what we'll always see Left unto complacency To right the wrong conspiracy Never what you used to see With eyes adorned in misery Choose commit right or wrong The road reaming ever long Truth in anger's compromise That shine the lies within your eyes Never was mistaken, never was the prize Never unforsaken, hide within your eyes Never an illusion, the ever rising tide This the constitution, harbored in your eyes
Aggravation, fuelin' me,Money powered, hypocrisy.I have no feelings, you're much the same.We have no feelings, we feel no pain!I am numb to all I see,This the way it has to be,Gone is hope, gone is need,I know! stone don't bleed.What's it worth? if I die.What's the reason? they all cry.I have no feelings, too much the same,Not my problem, I feel no blame.We are blind and we are cold,We're afraid of growing old.We are numb to all we see,Nothing sacred.Backs turned to madness,Backs to misery and I put the,Brush to the canvas!An' paint a world!Paint my world of:Hurt!World of hurt. Of hurt.We are blind and we are cold,Still afraid of growing old.We are numb to all we see,Nothing sacred.Hurt!!!Paints my world of hurt.Paints my world, in my world of!In my world of hurt!!!
Ain't no job too big or small,Just one sweep of the wreckin' ball.Put 'em up, we'll knock 'em down,Or knock 'em up, then leave town.Demolition of the mind.Desolation, left behind.Light the fuse, dynamite.Light the sky! in the night!We will walk!All over you!'Cause we are!The wreckin'! Wreckin' crew!We are the wreckin' crew.Wreckin' crew!We are the wreckin' crew.Destruction is a way life.Destruction, mayhem, havoc, strife.Crack a smile, here the sound.Watch 'em crumble to the ground.Innocence ain't no excuse,Slip your neck inside the noose.Pay in blood I demand,The wreckin' crew is outta hand.We'll wreck your neck!Wreckin' crew!Get wrecked!Turn to ashes, turn to dust.We're the ones that you can trust.Evil smile, wicked grin,Tear it down, begin to sin.Think that you will end it all,There's no one left to ball or call.When there ain't nothin' left to do,Call upon, the wreckin' crew!We'll wreck your neck!Wreckin' crew!Yer wreck!Ah! Wreckin' crew!Wreck! Wreck!
