Time melts away in this living inferno,Trapped by a cause that I once understood.Feeling a sickness building inside of me,Who will I really have to answer to.March on through the rivers of red.Souls drift, they fill the air.Forced to fight, behind,The crooked cross. Do only what is expected of me,With no emotions my feelings suppressed.Blind obedience carries me through it all.Conscience a word I learned to forget. March on through the rivers of red.Flesh burns, it fills the air. Forced to fight, behind,The crooked cross.Time melts away in this living inferno,Trapped by a cause that I once understood.Blind obedience carries me through it all,Do only what is expected of me. March on through the rivers of red.Souls drift, they fill the air.Forced to fight, behind,The crooked cross.

Body that rests before me,With every dying breath,Spellbound and gagged,I commence your flesh to dirt.Body that lay before me,In everlasting death.Entombed in abscess,To rot and lie stinking in the earth.Empty altar awaits its victimStained glass windows black.Candles burn the midnight oil,Incense fills the night.Observing trance awaking stateLying still unknowing.Reciting the passages of timePrepare for the impaling.Death's an art, flesh and earth never part,A power of the mind.Death shines on the air of silence,A ritual of endless time.Purged of your dead body,Sacrificed of your life.Unearthly ritual sealed in fireEnter the kingdom of desire.

Mankind in his insatiable search for divineKnowledge has discarded all biblical teachings Realizing that the strength of religion is the repression ofKnowledgeAll structures of religion have collapsed Life prays for deathIn the wake of the horror of these revelations It was never imagined how graphic the reality that wouldBe known as the endOf creationWould manifest itself We believe all this chaos and atrocity can be tracedBack to one single event We hold these truths to be painfully self-evidentAll men are not created equalOnly the strong will prosperOnly the strong will conquerOnly in the darkness of Christ have I realizedGod Hates Us All

Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise.Once forgotten soldiers come to life.Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done,Not content with wars we never won. Memories can't ignoreAnguish of beforeSatisfy the scorn.Rise ghosts of war. Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die.Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians denyDrive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie.[Memories can't ignoreAnguish of beforeSatisfy the scorn.Rise ghosts of war.]I deal in pain.All life I drain.I dominate.I seal your fate.I deal in pain.All life I drain.Memories can't ignore,Rise ghost of war.

Cascaded darknessWalls close in on me.Nailed shut but my eyes still see.Severe anguish as my body evolves.The pain of life after death it resolves.Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,The faint sounds of shoveled earth.Madness growing as your mind dissolves.Merely secret in my dreams.Night grows cold, twilight's near,On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcassNo spared breath.Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode.Dead soul,Stone cold,Out into the night.Voices inside my headHold me under.Voices oppress.Like roaring thunder.An echo bouncing inside my brain.How much can I take of the pain,The pain!A war raging deep inside my head,A split decision that will end with me dead.You see the agony in my eyes,Protruding aimless,I think it's time to die.A cannibal's desire feeds the fireThat burns in your head.Intense pain eats away at your brain,Thorazine pumping through your veins.Death walks inside you,Smell death around you,Hell's evil spell takes a soul,Hear the sound of the bellCounting off death tolls.Laughing as you eternally rot,Searching for human fleshAnd life's blood.Live Undead.
Enter my mind can you stop the rageNo one shall mourn or pity my graveFighting the world without remorseSearching for blood to never grow oldA personal hell is where I resideTaunting death sounds cadavers in painJudging my soul I am not his sonScreaming God's name I want some more[Chorus]You love to hate meBut you won't kill meSuicidal surgeDesensitize the worldTake what I want primordial groundHumanity bleeds from inside my veinsLosing all grasp an evil so oldVengeance it breeds driving you insaneExhaust all will hanging by the neckAnguish within let it blind the eyesBetter off dead us your epitaphApathy feeds the human demiseAbsolute reign a malevolent mindConceptions so vile in this bottomless soulTotal addicting, corrupt and profaneForce-fed lies in this chapel of lustDancing in blood disciples enslavedPutrefied walls adorned with your fleshCoating this shrine of the ungodly cross[Chorus]Pessimistic dreamsRealistic screamsCrucify creationMagnify damnationEnter my mind can you stop the rageNo one shall mourn or pity my graveFighting the world without remorseSearching for blood to never grow oldConceptions so vice in this bottomless soulPutrefied walls adorned with your fleshCoating this shrine of the ungodly cross[Chorus]

Ambushed by the spray of leadCount the bullet holes in your head.Offspring sent out to cry,Living mandatory suicide.Suicide. [x 4]LEAD: HANNEMANHoles burn deep in your chest,Raked by machine gun fire.Screaming soul sent out to die,Living mandatory suicide.Suicide. [x 4]LEAD: HANNEMAN [Spoken:]Lying, dying, screaming in pain.Begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain.Mines explode, pain sheers through your brain,Radical amputation, this is insane.Fly swatter stakes drive through your chest.Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest.Soldier of misfortuneHunting with bated breath.A vile smell, like tasting death.Dead bodies, dying and woundedLitter the city streetsShattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit.Dying [in] terror,Blood's cheap, it's everywhere.Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line.

Trapped in purgatoryA lifeless object aliveAwaiting reprisalDeath will be their acquisition The sky is turning redReturn to power draws nearFall into me, the sky's crimson tearsAbolish the rules made of stone Pierced from belowSouls of my treacherous pastBetrayed by manyNow ornaments dripping above Awaiting the hour of reprisalYour time slips away Raining bloodFrom a lacerated skyBleeding its horrorCreating my structureNow I shall reign in blood
Evangelist you claim God speaks through you,Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity.You care not for the old that suffer,When empty pockets cry from hunger.Penniless from their generosity,Sharing their money to quench your greed.Searching for the answer to their prayersThey cry their last wish of need.Save me. His spirit lives and breathes in me.The almighty transformed to your screen.The meanings lost in its translation,No holy words, describe his deception.You say you'll help us find the lord,Tell me preacher how do you knowA simple quest for a visible savior,To lead us through our final prayer.Save me. Send your donations,Contribute to the cause.Luxuries,Your righteous reward?Praise the lord, praise god,Is what you wish to sell.There is no heaven without a hell.In your mind's eye could you truly believe,That by giving you can save your soul,Could you be so naive!You heal the sick,[you] raise the dead,You blind the congregationWith the things you say.Religious blackmail a deceit of trust,That death will come and all will be lost.Can you hear the serpents call,Look deep in those deceiving eyes.Ignore the writing on the wall,You should read between the lies. When doubt subsides his honesty,An inquiry, is it blasphemy?Impure the soul, that's made to suffer,No sermons left to hide or cover,An empty promise, lie unfulfilled,To steal a dream or get it killed.They claim your trip to heavens nearby,You may believe it but Satan wouldn't lie.

Convicted witch my life will endAt midnight on the stakeMy dedicated life was spentTo insubordinateSecured by lock inside a cellImprisoned for no crimeThe shackles will be uselessWhen your life is out of time Incantation spell gone byI will see life againMy deals will made eternallyI signed the book of redMy rage will be unleashed againBurning the next mornDeath means nothing, there is no endI will be reborn No gift of exile in my fateI'll get no amnestyYou can't control my destinyThere is no habitual needProclaim my death, to end my wrathIt takes more than one tryIndulge your ineffective curseI will never die You think by killing me tonightMy powers will not riseThere'll be nowhere for you to runWhen my hatred comes to lifeCondemned to fill the prophecyAllowing no first bornDefy your morbid declarationLeave you ripped and tornCount your blessing would be priestAs I burn upon the stakeYou'd be forgiven endlesslyBut your values are all fakeForever servant of my LordBy choice and not submissionMaybe now I've made you wonderAm I superstitionIncantation spell gone byI will live againMy deals will made eternallyI signed the book in redMy rage will be unleashed againBurning the next mornDeath means nothing there is no endI will be reborn

I stalk close in from aboveSilent wings will test your faithDeath will never hear me passLaunch attack you're too lateI hear flak inside my headDeafening thunder cities burnCarpet-bombing laid to wasteThrowned inside a death maskHoly cross embedded in your tombCasualties are buried through your mindCertain death is screaming from the skyI live to destroy belowHunted victims are unseenFlying wrath a fortress hellWar machine to kill allI leave carnage in my wakeChoking bleeding for your lifeFaceless prey has been erasedSilence reigns you're dead nowHoly cross embedded in your tombCasualties are buried through your mindCertain death is screaming from the skyListen to the rhythm of a dead man walkingSilent is the heartbeat of the predator stalkingHear the sound of air feel the warmth touch your neckReality is not fair no time to second guessHear the distant ringing of the blade as it cuts through your neckSilent is the cry lying on your mattress of bloodAn easy mark for a veteran of executionI walk step by step with deathWhere all bludgeoned bodies lieYou will see my face of rageCut your heart out of your chestLeave impaled the consummation of mankind

Let me take you down without a soundDead before you hit the groundBlood washes my hand can't understandSterilizing my painWashed away with crimson tideBy my hand I keep testing timeQuench the fire that drives my soulSoothing me as death takes holdPeaceful and serene slowly bleedingEyes once bright are now fadingPallid ashen face against my skinStaring blindly at some distant placeWashed away by crimson tideBy my hand I keep testing timeStraight flesh lace adorns your neckSpilling your blood all over my fleshQuench the fire that drives my soulSoothing me as death takes holdDivine godsend enveloping meSpiritual ecstasy sets me free
I saw them all around todayThey don't stop they won't go awayThey love the darkness in my eyesHelp me find a way out when I'm lost within myself They show me everything I needThere's nothing wrong with a little greedNever enough to satisfySuch a driving desire that burns inside My life came with it's own scarsI don't need you to tell me about your sorrowI can't say I've seen it allBut I live for the things that keep me hollow Everyday I look into the mirrorStaring back I look less familiarI've seen all seven facesEach one looks a lot like me They all look like meI never see them comingBut they show me more of myselfDrawn into the depthsI never knew existedLaunching me face firstInto the pleasures of pure lust and greedI am becoming all things envied, I am the excessI want it all more pain more sex more lies more ofEverything My Life came with it's own scarsI don't need you to tell me about your sorrowI can't say I've seen it allBut I live for the things that keep me hollow Everyday I look into the mirrorStaring back I look less familiarI've seen all seven facesEach one looks a lot like meThey all look like me I am becoming all things envied, I am the excessI want it all more pain more sex more lies more ofEverything

An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time.Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.Judgment day the second coming arrives.Before you see the light you must die.Forgotten children, conform a new faith,Avidity and lust controlled by hate.[The] Never ending search for your shattered sanity,Souls of Damnation in their own reality. Chaos rampant,An age of distrust.Confrontations.Impulsive habitat. Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters,Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.Engreat souls condemned for all eternity,Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity.Chaos rampant,An age of distrust.Confrontations.Impulsive sabbath. On and on, south of heavenOn and on, south of heavenOn and on, south of heavenOn and on, south of heavenThe root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.A force that has lived all eternity.A never ending search for a truth never told.The loss of all hope and your dignity.Chaos rampant,An age of distrust.Confrontations.Impulsive habitat. On and on, south of heaven On and on, south of heavenOn and on, south of heavenOn and on, south of heaven
Come walk with me through endless time.See what has been and what the future sees.Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed,Step in a life that's yet to be born. You spill the blood,Eternal soul. I'll show you sights that you would not believe.Experience pleasures thought unobtained.At one with evil that has ruled before.Now smell the stench of immortality. You spill the blood,Eternal soul.Spill your blood, let it run on to me,Take my hand and let go of your life.Close your eyes and see what is me,Raise the chalice, embrace for evermore. You've spilt the blood.I have your soul.
