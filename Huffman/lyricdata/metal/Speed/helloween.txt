(helloween)Kiske:Well, japan. we've been there, I think, two times now, and it's always beenA great fun playing there. I like the venues. they are sounding very good,They look very good, and kids over there really appreciate good music andStuff. and I think the next time we're gonna play at the budokan, which isPretty cool. lookin' forward to it. it's gonna be fun.Schwichtenberg:Japan has been always great to play there, and will be in the future. andJapan people are great, it's fun to play there and you feel very confidentAnd convinient or whatever to play there. and japanese people are listeningVery carefully, I don't know. it's great to be in japan.Kiske:"kids of the century" is the first life sign of us after two and a halfYears. and after all those rumours going around about this band meLeaving the band, me splitting up, or the band splitting up, and all thatStuff, which has been quite a lot. maybe that's normal when the band's notOn the scene for a while. but after that it feels really good to have,Actually, a new album ready and a single out. so the kids know we are stillThere. and with the music you can prove what you can do still even withoutOne guy that just left the band. I think we found the right person there,Roland. and I think the album says everything. yeah, I wrote "kids of theCentury" about more than two years ago now. and remembering that time IFeel like, when I wrote that song, I was in that feel of that all the kidsToday, they just feel like they haven't got anything to do with theProblems. everything goes wrong, the nature or whatever. just came out ofThat feeling actually. and that's what the song's all about, I think. whatThe kids today...because I feel like everybody's responsible, especiallyThe kids. if they don't feel like they have to change anything or have toMake things better, nobody will.Schwichtenberg:I think having roland in the band is.. we are as lucky as we have michaelIn the band by that time, we are lucky having roland in the band. and he'sJust doing great songs and great guitar work he's doing. and a good pal asWell. he's a nice fellow. and he just fits in the band very much. I thinkThe fans will accept him of course.Weikath:Well, the nice thing about roland being in the band is that I saw himLike, I don't know, fifteen years ago or so on stage, and I thought thatWas pretty impressing, what he did there, and I could never forget aboutThat. and that's why actually I called him up then when we needed anotherGuitarist, "remember that guy? ". and so it took me, like, four hours toFind out the number, like I had to phone up musicians I knew and suddenlySomehow I got the number, and phoned him up: "you might not know me, but IKnow you. how about playing guitar in helloween? " and he didn't even knowThe band. so I had to give him some examples of our songs, like reallyLoud, cranked it up. and so, well, he was interested, like it quite a lot.And then we went to rehearsing, we had to do the whole stuff within twoMonths. 'cause then we had to go on an american tour and japan meant twoHours of playing. and well, ha ha, quite a tough job I would say. afterAll, I mean, we can handle that, we are pretty good, you know. and I'mSorry about that, but well... yeah, roland is a very nice guy. he'sDoing a big part of the band with his character, and his kind of being.And it's quite a difference too how the whole thing worked before, becauseHe is a completely different character. he is a lot more calm and veryCritical. he's always got his own opinion and that's exactly what we need.Kiske:Yeah, we recorded the album at puk studio in denmark, which is a very goodStudio, I think, very lovely place. it's right in the middle of nowhereBut that's actually what we wanted, to really concentrate on the album.And working with chris was pretty cool, because he's got a very strongSense of humor as we like it. and we had some cool moments there andThat's all caught on the album. yeah, the production that chrisTsangarides has done is right in your face. that's the best descriptionOf the sound actually. so just check it out!Schwichtenberg:Crystal clear, or...Kiske:Crystal tsangarides clear, ha ha!Weikath:I would say thank you to everybody who kept up the faith during all thatTime, and after all, those rumours are untrue.Schwichtenberg:The best thing for the fans, for the people who like us, is just to listenWhat comes from us directly, like this now, and the album of course.Kiske:Yeah, especially the album.Schwichtenberg:Don't trust any rumours or whatever.Kiske:The thing is, forget about what's been in the magazines, or what has beenSaid, or all the stuff. and just check out the album and you know what'sGoing on. of course, the single as well.Schwichtenberg:Thanks for keeping the faith.

[Music & Lyrics: Grosskopf] We try to force our final fortuneAs if we knew the final scoreAnd we pretend to know things betterIn our madness we ignoreHow small we areWe are Far above this ignoranceA higher force you'll findForever giving answers to the blind When fate comes calling youYou don't know what to doBehind the world we're living inIs so much more than we do knowThere's ONE who loves you soBehind the world we're living inThere's so much more than we will ever get to know Protecting nations, wealth and soldiersCollecting fame and victoryInventing star-ships, tanks and rocketsBut still we don't know how to seeThe love in our heartsOur hearts Far from all this ignoranceA higher force would shareVerity and hopeBut we don't care When fate comes calling youYou don't know what to doBehind the world we're living inIs so much more than we do knowThere's ONE who loves you soBehind the world we're living inThere's so much more than we will ever get to know
Why you come tonight to take my live? I know one day it's time to goWhy don't you give me one more chance? I know that I can try to die another timeDon't wait for me, I'm gonna stayBecause there's much more to get clear You are always on timePatiently you wait for meBut you know I'm always too lateTry another day I don't know where to goWhen the time has come for meIs it heaven or hell? Well you'll tell me againTell I know what to doIn the endless shades of spaceIs it heaven or hell? You will tell me againTo find my freedom Hey, come onGo date an other mateI bade you once ago to goBut now you're back too soon againYou said that I could payWhen all my fear would stay awayInstead my life is high and dryI'm still afraid to die You are always on timePatiently you wait for meBut you know I'm always too lateCome another day I don't know where to goWhen the time has come for meIs it heaven or hell? Well you'll tell me againTell I know what to doIn the endless shades of spaceIs it heaven or hell? You will tell me againTo find my freedomEverlasting freedom

A lot of things occur each dayWe've got to live with on our wayThere's so much misery on the screenWith commercials in betweenAnd the Russians won't be so lateUncle Sam don't want to waitNo matter if you're black or whiteYou never ever had a rightAnd look up to the eternal skiesSee warfare even thereWhat once has been a paradiseNow destruction and despairIn other worlds the children dieLacking food ill from a flyOppressed by troops to tame their landIt's all the same againIf any man is free on earthThen tormentors steal his birthThey slam gun butts in his faceAnd leave his woman choked in maceSo stand up for our human rightsPush back this pest of hateRaise you voice pass on the lightUnite! it's not too late[Chorus]How many tears flow awayTo become a sea of fearsHow many hearts are torn apartTill another torment startsBut before the worldTurns into a sunAll cruelty and violenceOn earth will be dead and goneSo stand up for our human rightsPush back this pest of hateRaise you voice pass on the lightUnite! it's not too late[Chorus]
(m&l; - grosskopf)I'm always on the run with my guitar and my old shoesI'm movin' and I'm groovin' and I really got the bluesI'm always havin' fun and I've got nothin' left to loseI never tune my guitar 'cause I like the way it grooves Sitting in a sleazy bar I'm slowly goin' downI ain't got no more money but I know you'll be aroundEarly in the morning and the first kiss isn't farI ain't got nothing better than my girl and my guitar We're rockin' and we're rolling and we don't know what we doWe play so loud and out of tune I need a new tattooWe don't give a damn-shit we five horsemen on the runWe only wanna go out there and have a lot of fun Sitting in a sleazy bar I'm slowly goin' downI ain't got no more money but I know you'll be aroundEarly in the morning and the first kiss isn't farI ain't got nothing better than my girl and my guitar Take me through the night and I will always be with youFeel me, touch me, hear me, yes I love the things we doLove me and I show you just the way I love you tooWe belong together and I never let you go
(m&l; - kiske) Give me two strong arms to fight my enemiesGive me two strong eyes to see the truthGive me two strong legs I think I have to runAnd fill my heart with faith that I won't loseI don't wanna lose Give me one real love that I don't freeze out thereMake me feel your presence in the nightGive me one strong heart that tells me when I lieAnd tha my soul so I won't have to hideI don't wanna hide It's so cold deep dpwn hereI know we had to fallSouls are dying everwhereBut whatever I do I belive, I belive There'll be no reason to liveWithout you giving me lightThere is so much that you giveYour love is shining so bright I belive, I belive I wanna love but I always hateI wanna give but I always takeWant you to laught but I make you cryMaybe I won't change until I die It's so much easier said than doneI know I can't just always runGot so much anger inside of meI understand but I think I see what I'm not I know it's true what j.c. saidI got all clear in my headSeems we were born to be unfairI am a sinner that's starting to dare to belive Give me your hand until the endAnd I will walk into the promised landI don't deserve anything you doBut I can't stop loving you No more lies, no false relogionsNo more whys and wrong God missionsNo shiny t.v priests begging for cashNo more wars that no god's ever asked for There's a way back out of thereOne day we're goin'homeTell everyone who wants to hear:Whatever you do: Do belive, I beliveWe belive, belive oh!

From our lives' beginning onWe are pushed in little formsNo one asks us how we like to beIn school they teach you what to thinkBut everyone says different thingsBut they're all convinced thatThey're the ones to seeBridge:So they keep talking and they never stopAnd at a certain point you give it upSo the only thing that's left to think is thisChorus:I want out--to live my life aloneI want out--leave me beI want out--to do things on my ownI want out--to live my life and to be freePeople tell me A and be They tell me how I have to seeThings that I have seen already clearSo they push me then from side to sideThey're pushing me from black to whiteThey're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hearBridge:But don't push me to the maximumShut your mouth and take it home'Cause I decide the way things gonna beChorus:I want out--to live my life aloneI want out--leave me beI want out--to do things on my ownI want out--to live my life and to be freeThere's a million ways to see the things in lifeA million ways to be the foolIn the end of it, none of us is rightSometimes we need to be alone(Solo: Kai/Both)No no no, leave me aloneChorus:I want out--to live my life aloneI want out--leave me beI want out--to do things on my ownI want out--to live my life and to be free
We hurt who we love we destroy what we needFor profit we sell our soulsWe're sowing disaster, the mess is complete, Resources will soon be consumed Open your eyes see the signs all around; Hoping fate will have mercy on allSomeday the next generation will payBut one day it' s too late to regret If a mountain could talk it would tell us a storyTo reign in love means just how to say sorryIf an ocean could cry we would drown in it's tearsDusk breaks to dawn, Which we cannot survive without love Time passes by, time's gonna flyLife is much too short to understand itDon't even try Time passes by, time's gonna flyDon't fill up your heart with hate and angerGive it a try I know that things are going wrong sometimesBut then we need to get it rightI feel the pressure's so intense, sometimes, I know we need a change tonight. If a mountain could talk it...  Always on time always right on trackExpectations are set to the limitIs it too late is there no turning backAll I need is a moment in peace
No fear, no painNobody left to blameI'll try aloneMake destiny my ownI learn to free my mindMyself I now must findOnce moreOnce moreIf I could flyLike the king of the skyCould not tumble nor fallI would picture it allIf I could flySee the world through my eyesWould not stumble nor failTo the heavens I sailIf I could flySo here I amIn solitude I standI've got dreams insideI need to realizeMy faith has grownNo fear of the unknownNo moreNo moreIf I could flyLike the king of the skyCould not tumble nor fallI would picture it allIf I could flySee the world through my eyesWould not stumble nor failI could ravage my jailIf I could fly

(m - grosskopf, l - kiske) Thunder, flash and lightningIs working on my backThe tables in the kitchenAre tryin' to break my neck All the late night memoriesAre learning I'm my shoesMy mother's old greyLeather gloves are singing loud the blues I can taste what's in the sunNo time to waste 'cause there is noneWhen I feel blue I see it shineBut still it's true I'm doin' fine You can't see me'cause now I'm all freeNow you know I'm throughAn all that's not new Sitting on a paperback'cause I don't know what really crecksI'm trying to climb my pencilTo get him high No one tells me what to do'cause ano one knows what I've been throughYou don't know a thingBut you can learn It's time to touch the skyMy mind is free I fly I can taste what's in the sunNo time to waste 'cause there is noneWhen I feel blue I see it shineBut still it's true I'm doin' fine You can't see me'cause now I'm all freeNow you know I'm throughAn all that's not new
I'm free, as free as one can beIn a world that cries for more equalityI'm free, as free as one can beIn this world so full of tears and miseryToday Faster and faster we run into life, no time for emotionsHigher and higher we raise our limits too fastLost with protectors and will to survive, it's an illusionColder and colder it gets as we walk down the line I don't wanna be a partOf that foolish gameI just try another startNothing stays the same I'm free, as free as one can beIn a world that cries for more equalityI'm free, as free as one can beIn this world so full of tears and miseryToday Stronger and stronger we march into thyDon't show no weaknessDon't show no mercy for those who are allied in painStay where you are no complaining at all Never get restlessNever just step out of line cause it won't be the same I don't wanna be a partOf that foolish gameI just try another startOr else I go insane I'm free, as free as one can beIn a world that cries for more equalityI'm free, as free as one can beIn this world so full of tears and miseryToday I'm free, as free as one can beIn a world that cries for more equalityI'm free, as free as one can beIn this world so full of tears and miseryTodayTodayTodayToday

In the night I'm calling you!Be my guide help me through!In the night I call your nameYou're the light in times of shame!The songs I singAll my love I bring for you!I always try to make things betterEverything that has gone wrongMighty plans in the right directionBut very little has been doneEveryday when I try to get forwardI find myself another mile backHelp me fighting!Help me breathing!Why am I falling down instead?Every useful minute seems to be the thought of youEvery hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might doWithout love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!In the nightSometimes I cried after all I lied to youFree from ourselves and free from this world we may findThe freedom we search'Cause all that we need is inside!The hours we waste we may not get back for a whileAnd when it gets darkNo chance will be there for a tryWhen I wake up early in the morningI catch a book and jump insideI fill my head with a million wondersAnd try to fill the night with lightThe moment when I get things clearerI see another mountain to climbAnd always when I think I'm nearerI realize there is no timeIn the nightThis song I sing, all my love I bring for you!

Feelings come and go, I've never knownSomething longs to grow, won't let goSpirits 'round my head, are whisperingI turn inside instead, of wonderingDeep inside of me, I know there's got to beA different kind of truth, that sets the spirit freeIf I don't want to know, what's written inside meHow could I see anything, how could I be anything?Restless minds have searched, long beforeThe truth will be the same, for evermoreThe mightiness of trees, that you can feelCan give you all you need, just listen stillHere is love and there is painIt's all around, it's all the sameThere's nothing new that I could tell to youBut still there is the universe inside of us that never burstsWe might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't rejectThe truth that is in everything, that is and has been and will beThere is a long way to go, there is a high place to knowThere is a world to go through, but there's so much more to doUntil we're home!Deep inside of me, I know there'sFeelings come and go, I've never known

Tried so hard to understand all of your feelingsTried to cope with your insanitiesCome to think about too many ways of healingWhat we lost or maybe never hadOne small step into the hidden decoyOne more world is help and one will destroyI woke up in the midnight sunSo aware damage has been doneAgony or sanctuaryOnly fate will show the wayFrom the bright of day into the jaw of darknessOne is shoved, a victim of lieFriendly face turns into a fiery grimaceSuddenly feelings learn to dieUsed up sympathy no chance to returnTo a world one know but would's that will burnSpent more time in the midnight sunStill aware of what else has goneAgonized and hypnotizedWhen will I be shown the wayFell asleep and no midnight sunStill aware justice has been doneNo more doubts but disbeliefWhen the night was dayCelebration, miracleAnd fate did show the way

How can I stay when Im trying to say,That I cant live without the rain,Yes I cant live without the rain.How can I feel what Im trying to feel,How can I move when Im heel to heel,Youre always shouting about the doubt in my eye,But I cant answer cos my eyes are so dry.Now I cant live without the rain.Yes I cant live without the rain.I cant live without the rain,Thats falling on my head,Rain thats falling on my head.Rain thats falling,Rain thats falling,Rain thats falling on my head.Id started thinking back to you when,Id like to send a line but then again,How can I write you when there aint no light,Im feeling tight tonight but thats alright.Now I cant live without the rain,Yes I cant live without the rain.
Since ages now we're caught and occupied With our basic civil rights denied They came-to-conquer, took our beloved world We're left to thrive in sorrow and disgrace  Some never knew what freedom was Now, there's guards everywhere Someone come!... Rise up tomorrow to rectify the injustice being done  Raise the noise bring it on I'll sing it while you're gone Forever and ever On with this for as long There won't be another song now or whenever  But they're flawed, they crave the sound of our melodies Though exposed to complex things just faint This way they're rendered helpless easy prey To be grabbed and bound safely locked away  Aldo here's one guy to play the pipe Summons mean tunes that kill Stadium like set up and verified Knock 'em out with your skill  Raise the noise bring it on I'll sing it while you're gone Forever and ever On with this for as long There won't be another song now or whenever  Raise the noise bring it on I'll sing it while you're gone Now and forever On with this for as long There won't be another song now or whenever

Coming from the sewerage creepin' through the pipesBorn from modern chemistry a thing that is aliveGrowing in this rotten crap at places no one wipesEating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thriveThe scientists got no way to fightFor they can't find any weak point to get rid of it rightYou live your life and you don't know what's goin' onYou just can't stop a thinking that the officials do you wrongYou're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's armAnd the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harmEven thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the doorFrustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whoreYou won't believe 'till you know that it's realFrom the pain in your stomach and the horror you feelYou need a shit so you head off to the looYou're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do ![Chorus]There's the Reptile (Reptile)Just see his eyesReptile (Reptile)Can you see the beast arise[Chorus]Reptile (Reptile)Creeping up on youReptile (Reptile)There's nothing left that you can do[Chorus]And there's the Reptile (Reptile)Hidden till nowReptile (Reptile)But now it's there you don't know how[Chorus]Reptile (Reptile)Just watch it growReptile (Reptile)And there's no more human being left but youOerrrps !

Only a few steps aheadYou'll see chances you can't ignoreOnly a few days agoLife seemed useless and sadNow you can see what it's likeWhen you know what you're fighting forNow you can see what it's worthTo believe in your faith[Chorus:]Revolution, revolutionTear it once apartFor a brand new startRevolution, revolutionLet me guess what's in your mindAnd lies in your heartNow you can see things much clearerAs long as you understandHow you can use your convictionAnd build something newFollow your visionsKeep being suspicious and curiousNever accept an excuseAnd learn how to say "no"[Chorus:]In the midnight hourMaking future plansSelfless with the tragedy in your eyesFeel the mighty hungerDeep inside your soulKeeps you fighting for justiceAnd for the truth[Chorus:]
Well, I think it's really time again for a revolutionNot to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's thereCan you remember a time when water was still waterOr are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirsInhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain!I'll surely make our children feel a lot more sane!Revolution now!I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissanceAnd today we're all faced with death, rubbers, and AIDSIn '68 some people went out to fight for freedomThey would never ever have thought that their children wear tiesAnd if you come to San FranciscoYou're gonna meet some broken people thereRevolution now!
Much too long I've been a prisoner hereThe hour has come to break outShackled and chained almost goin' insaneIt's better to live on the runSet me free, set me freeSend me a sign, want to leave it all behindI'll be leaving the hands of doomRearrange the master plan, take the future in my handsTo be free and not trapped anymore[Chorus]Ride the sky, Ride the skyGive me wings to fly, Ride the skyI have to think for myself and then actIn conformity of my own thoughtsNo one should tell me what's wrong and what's rightWhy don't you leave me aloneSet me free, set me free[Chorus][Chorus]
We're living in our unitsAnd one thing we can do isWork for a life without a fate We don't pay any taxesBut the state is the axesOf our minds without love without hate We have a higher orderNo one needs to be a hoarderOur society is such a glorious thing In our centers we can dream ofAnything you never think ofYou can't say we are puppets on a string Our minds are kept so cleanChecked up on a screenThey're holy men, they're saintsWithout them we might all fail We don't know war and crimeThings of ancient timesWe just see it if we put on video The blue pass is for my lifeAnd the red one's for my wifeIt's the only thing we really need to show There are still some without rulesBut I tell you, they're all foolsThe Guardians will find them as we've seen We got banks where we freeze themThey get new brains screwed in thenAnd act contrarily to what they have been With new minds made so cleanChecked up on a screenThey will be the saintsWithout them we might all fail [Chorus:]Guardians of our livesProtect securityThey turn the key and they step inControlling you and meGuardians of our livesTake care eternally [Solo: both / Kai / Mike] [Chorus] Puppets on a stringPuppets on a string

[Music: A. Deris, S. Gerstner / Lyrics: A.

A tramp found dead, in the street, just made the newsForensics report read 'drug abuse'Found a warehouse slip in his sleeveMarine corps major down-at-heel They got to the place, unlocked the she'dSoon left awestruck, stunned, amazedAmong stuff and things lay pledges and bondsUp to a few Mil in the end The sage the fool the sinnerAnd what goes for you, one can't ever sayThe sage the fool the sinner One can't foretell fate, no way, no way Sassy lady puts on her fav heelsMirror checked, all done - snow white appealAdjust the dress, ready to leaveGrab some cash, cab's outside, wipe off a tear On her way out, she turns once moreTo wave her man good - byeWhile in his sleep, he recalls thirty years - due to end that night.
[Music & Lyrics: Weikath] Gimme gimme sell your soulsI skin and strip you bold(ly)My revenue ain't yoursAll means my way, I'm mighty I clutch what's mine, yours sevenfoldI leave you in the coldGot all my schemes in placeYou stifle in my maze All you shystersSeek shelter on the last dayWhile you laugh loud, disclaimingAs your dire end will come/dawn on you Ah you..!Possessed, in your mask, and a dirty heartUnrest in ye must've been the devil in all of us The saints are marching againAnd harvest soulsTaking every single one The saints march againAnd harmonyIs here, ye can go testify Don?t you dream you?re ever safeI ll get you in your graveGo molest your heirs with mysleight of hand attorneys - I Profit at your dear expenseCash in, perform my pranceRelinquish and lose what youtoiled for, anyway

No more feel, no more healNo more light meets my eyesIs it night, is it dayI'm alone, paralyzed Everybody is waiting for the oneEveryone will freeze to death alone The smile of the sunWas stolen - someoneHas taken awayThe heart of all dayThe smile of the sunIs gone and no oneBut you drives awayThe pain of the greyIs anybody out thereSomebody help me Got to breathe, got to moveGot to get back my lifeHere's no hope, here's no joyIn this world full of strifeGone away, gone astrayAll I once believed inIt's my soul, it's my heartIt beats slower and dies Everybody is waiting for the oneEveryone will freeze to death alone The smile of the sunWas stolen - someoneHas taken awayThe heart of all dayThe smile of the sunIs gone and no oneBut you drives awayThe pain of the greyIs anybody out there waitingAnybody out there for meThe smile of the sunWas stolenSomebody help me The smile of the sunIs gone and no oneBut you drives awayThe pain of the grey The smile of the sunWas stolen - someoneHas taken awayThe heart of all dayThe smile of the sunIs gone and no oneBut you drives awayThe pain of the greyIs anybody out there waitingAnybody out there for meIs anybody out there searchingAnybody out there, call meThe smile of the sunWas stolenSomebody help me
Sometimes there's no tomorrowSometimes you hate the dayYou feel there may be somethingThat intends to screw with fateTake a look at what surround youEach time you watch the newsYour mind gets set by someone's willA template you can't chooseLove and desire, dry ice or fireDon't you just want to flee their magic spellNo mercy for the nations two people are at warBeliefs divide the dream they share of peace and harmonyTheir eyes look up to heaven, address our god in prayersTheir souls exposed, they may decease by emperor's decreeLook, how they're cryingThere's no denyingNow change the channel you're remote controlAnd the tune goes on eternallyFor those who share the fearOn a frequency for you and meYou stare but you can't seeYou hear and you agreeWe're all here for a reasonSo we can't just hang aroundThere's so much left to see and learnMake way for common groundAnd those who head the wrong wayWill rate as minor classAs castaways they'll render foolsWhen the horsemen come to ruleStrike the last hour in their glass towersInfinite lust has made the curtain fallAnd the tune goes on eternallyFor those who share the fearOn a frequency for you and meYou stare but you can't seeYou hear but you agreeYou agreeAnd the tune goes on eternallyFor those who share the fearOn a frequency for you and meYou stare but you can't seeYou hear but you agreeAnd the tune goes on eternallyFor those who long to hearAnd those freaks sense they're superiorWe're hypnotised, you seeThey wave and we agree
Feel it running offSo strong and clearAn age is over fastAnd disappearsHelp him if you canHis hour will come soonPush away his fearHe'll see ElysiumIt's timeIt's timeGuard him a little whileAnd calm his shiverWash and dry his tearsAnd cold his feverTake the bibles wordsSpeak it pure his soulLay love in his mindHis close to the final goalIt's timeIt's timeIt's time to goTime for the freedomTime to face what we all believe inPray strongPray to the higherTurn your back on the devil's fireTime to goTime for freedomTime to face what we all believe inTime is passing byWhen his mind is clearHe called your brotherNow his brain is dazedIt's resigning ratherMother take his handSay a last good-byeWe're not gifted toTurn water into wineIt's timeIt's timeIt's time to goTime for the freedomTime to face what we all believe inPray strongPray to the higherTurn your back on the devil's fireTime to goTime for freedomTime to face what we all believe inTime is passing by

This song is instrumental
Blackened sky a final flashDeath is in the airWarriors without a faceDestruction everywhereSilent falls the hammerNo one hears the criesNo escaping from this hellYour prayers won't be heard, so dieBrainless cruel commandersSending death and painSoldiers only robotsFight for their life in vainSilent falls the hammerNo one hears the criesNo escaping from this hellYour prayers won't be heard, so dieDie now die warrior!Die now die warrior!Somewhere in the shelter sit the menWho hold your fate in handsPlayin' chess and you're the loserYou're a small pawn in their gameSomewhere in the shelter sit the menAnd they don't realiseA war without survivors is a fightThat's never won, so die!Barren land desolate wasteDestruction is completeSurvivors creeping through the ruinsDecaying flesh and meatSomewhere in a shelterSome pigs are still aliveAnd still they play the gameThey don't give a damn...so die!

I'm reaching out to find a reasonTo find an answer and reliefI see a world so strange and coldI see a world of rules and thievesThe day you're born you're under pressureYour life is well prepared my friendThey surely teach you what to think how to behave until the endAll I ever wanted is a little piece of lifeIn a world where I decide things on my ownAll I ever needed is a little piece of hopeAnd then things are gonna turn the other wayI'm living in a world of fantasyReality ain't good enough for meAnd all that I can feel is nothing but sobrietyI'm living in a world of fantasyReality ain't meant or made for meAll that I see is so unrealAnd once you're old enough they teach youNot to be wishful not to careAbout the plan that's been already made for you by other handsBut when you fail there's no one out thereTo take your hand to catch your tearsThe whole construction we have built leaves no such room for blinding fearsI wonder I wonder if I can handle it allI wonder I wonder if I can carry the weight of the world
When I hold the key to open heaven's doorI will never make the mistake and give it backWhen I hold the key to open my mind before it's too lateI will never give it backThere's just one way I seeThe way I think it's right for meYou say to me I will repent what I doIf it's right I'll stop beforeWhen I see the light of sun will fade awayAnd I reveal what I have loved beforeIt's too late when I can't see the hours I payAnd I reveal what I have loved beforeThere's just one way I seeThe way I think it's right for meYou say to me I will repent what I doIf it's right I'll stop before[Chorus]The life I try to give isAll I have inside of meIt's one kind of life for meThis music you hearThe strength we have inside isSo much more than you will knowBut if you can't see the life aroundYou'll always walk aloneLook at the drunk man, look into his eyesSee his strong handsBut tomorrow they will tremble cold as iceSee the drunk man, try to ask him whyHe will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lieThere's a fight in his head he cannot winGetting stronger, makes him mad, burning sinYou... you cannot hideYou... you cannot describe your feelings inside[Chorus]
(m&l; - grosskopf)To give what I got, to take what I need to live, it ain't easy for me,Darken my eyes, tell me lies, but all nice, tell me how I have to be,Get me in your foolish game, destroy my defence, lock me in,Throw me in your lion's cage, 'cause then I'm out of your way,Cry with the wolves, run with the pack,Turn around to save your neck,'cause someone always keeps you in confusion,Squeezed in a box, who'll win the race,Ask no questions in this case,What's left is only you and your illusions,Charity is all your duty, they preach you: sharing your goods is your pride,Patriotic-love, kill the enemy first, I can hear the other side,What's the way out of this game? you'll either win or you lose,I run in circles, who's to blame? is there a way I can choose?Cry with the wolves, run with the pack,Turn around to save your neck,'cause someone always keeps you in confusion,Squeezed in a box, who'll win the race,Ask no questions in this case,What's left is only you and your illusions,I'm juggling on a rope without a net and hope,I keep my balance 'cause I see them smile with open jaws,And if I'm falling down, then I will soon be torn.A squabble over prey: who gets the best part out of me,To take the needle is a one-way trip without a coming back,You take it and you still will see reality'll make upon you.
You think you are aloneIn this universeWhat would you say if there are someArmed with all you deserve Destiny my friend you'll seeCounts nothing anymoreOpen up your mind now and realizeThey may come for sure Dead and goneNo survivorsThey'll hit and crush our earthYou stupid mankind Evolution everywhereWho do you think you areLike you are on the top of there?They may come for warMore evil, violent and vainThan you could ever beCan beam through time and bring you painAll dead no one flees Destiny my friend you'll seeCounts nothing anymoreOpen up your mind now and realize They may come for sure Dead and goneNo survivorsThey'll hit and crush our earthWith no mercyDead and goneNo more fightingThey'll kill and burn your earthYou stupid mankind They don't careThey don't careThey don't careThey don't care Dead and goneNo survivorsThey'll hit and crush our earthWith no mercyDead and goneNo more fightingThey'll kill and burn your earthYou stupid mankind
Now there is this day, a lot of things are changingCan't just kick it away, got to get things rightSometimes it happens fast and nothin' seems to lastThe thing that I once started isn't mine anymoreI guess now it's my turnYou've got a face like a child, got a mind like a womanYour smile is warm and tenderI hear the people say that I should stay awayFrom you and all the problems you might bringThey'll never know, youNobody ever knows what to doThey'll never see you cryThey'll never know whyNow it's your turn to break freeWhen you want it all you've got to seeNow it's your turn to break freeWhen you want the life, you've got to see what it meansSee the little boy holding mama's handHis eyes can see the things we've long forgottenThe world is easy now, and somehowHe's rightUntil there is this day when Mickey Mouse must go awayIt's your turn to break freeThis world is crying to be freeThis world is dying can't you seeWe need a turn to do it rightWe need a mind-revolutionTo get away from this selfishnessStop playing blind, break free
