Pictures of what used to be,Lie in pieces on the floorFinds himself in an empty room,Her voice calls out to himHe opens the door, but there's no one thereNo one there...Draped in a silken glow of moonlightThrough the mist I see, a lucid cathedral appears to me.Pray for a glimpse of touch of sunlightChain our shadow down, night settles in, my love,You never make a sound.Love is flowing from my fingertipsNever in control of this domain.All around me, my essence layWatch the vultures circle through the pouring rain.Close your eyes - and try to rememberDiscordant lullabies of days gone by.Close your eyes - on the edge of foreverA chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.As the walls converge around me.Castles crumbling down, everything is notAs it seems to be.Once more, I fells I must returnNo more will my soul burn. Dawn breaks the ground,My love,And with it you fade away...Close your eyes - and try to rememberDiscordant lullabies of days gone by.Close your eyes - on the edge of foreverA chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.Close your eyes - and try to rememberDiscordant lullabies of days gone by.Close your eyes - on the edge of foreverA chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.My love never dies...

Have I lost my mind?Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting meScars will fade but never dieStaring down at meThrough my eyes I can seeAl the terror and pain still live onI can't leaveSilver strand is pulling me back to mortalityAs the knife cuts to the veinAm I going insane? Have I lost my mind?Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting meScars will fade but never die
Forged in blood, carved in stone, Right before your eyes, you've always knownSee the truth inside yourself, see the world like no one elseOh, if only you were king, you could change everything. Can't you see what they're doing to you and me? We rule, we flyAbove the lights of the neon skyWe fight, we cryThe Lords of Chaos will never die All you see must be destroyedYour destiny you can't avoidShow them all your demon signTell them all to get in lineThere's no time to wasteIt's poison but they can't taste it. Can't you see what they're doing to you and me? We rule, we flyAbove the lights of the neon skyWe fight and we cryThe Lords of Chaos will never dieWill never die. The quick and the deadMoving fast they're in your headInfection spreads in the blood of the damned The truth and the liesIt's all the same, it's just a gameYou see, day and night you hold them in your hands, oh...  Oh, can't you see what they're doing to you and me? We rule, we flyAbove the lights of the neon skyWe fight and we cryThe Lords of Chaos will never die We rule, we flyAbove the lights of the neon sky, oh... We fight, we cryThe Lords of Chaos will never ever die
[Part I Odysseus' Theme / Overture][music / orchestration - Romeo] [instrumental] [Part II - Journey to Ithaca][music - Romeo][lyrics - Allen, Romeo] To the one that I love, my journey has begun When our eyes meet once more there will me peace The taste of your lips the warmth of your touch Again, forever, two souls as one  Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied Home - I'm dreaming of home I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew To return would make my dreams come true  Seasons of sorrow have stolen all my years I miss the rolling hills of Ithaca I've been through battles and cried a sea of tears But the tide is changing, and with it all my fears  Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied Home - I'm dreaming of home I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew To return would make my dreams come true  Behold the sea and winds of Jove We set sail guided by the stars above The ports of Troy escape our view A cold and stormy fate awaits our rendezvous  Onward we ride, into the raging fury Setting our course by the moon and sun We forge ahead seeking glory Yet the journey has just begun  Onward we ride - nine days we brave her might We are coming home...  [Part III - The Eye][music- Romeo][lyrics - Romeo] Awakened at dawn - Land dead ahead With the winds of the morning we change course No remorse, a place forbidden to all  Search all the grounds - find food and water Yet journey not into the Cave of Woe Long ago, a legend spoke of a beast  A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone A thousand nightmares mortal's blood forever flows  A mountainous black - engulfed in a shadow A bone-chilling growl and an Eye of Hate A ghastly fate - held prisoner by the Eye  Yet he must sleep - as the daylight fades We focus our senses and sharpen our blade We take aim - In silence we strike  A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone A thousand nightmares - blood runs forever - from the Eye...  [Part IV - Circe (Daughter of the Sun)][music - Romeo][Lyrics - Romeo] We sit adrift on the open sea The gift of wind, by Zeus, concealed - so carelessly We break the waves on a course untrue Across the endless plain of blue - a new coast in view  We carouse with the maiden Beneath her eyes the madness lies ...in mystery  I drink deep from the chalice Of gold and jade - my senses fade ...I'm mesmerized  Stay - like those before I condemn you all - from walk to crawl ...metamorphasized  No - my will it defies her Speak the verse - lift the curse ...she's mesmerized  Am I asleep? Tell me Daughter of the Sun There's vengeance in the air and all things will be undone  [Part V - Sirens][music - Romeo][lyrics - Romeo] Dire warnings - Told by the sorceress in white 'false bringers of love' - Sirens Echoing songs from above  Wings flowing - Floating on Sea of Lies I defy their vision Elysium swallows my cries  Embracing - Maidens of lust stimulate And manipulate my senses I welcome a watery grave  Tied steadfast to the mast Tragedy awaits me I'm falling victim Betrayed by the sea  [Part VI - Scylla and Charybdis] [a) Gulf of Doom][b) Drifting Home][music / orchestration - Romeo] [instrumental] [Part VII - The Fate of the Suitors / Champion of Ithaca][music - Romeo][lyrics - Lepond, Romeo] So this is home... In the guise of a beggar - Minerva guides my way I find my kingdom in jeopardy  Vengeance - it swells within me As I spy so many who eye my Queen I'll make them pay for this blasphemy... All will see  Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca I will right all the wrongs Let the Gods sing my song Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca Let a new life begin My journey has come to and end  A contest of valor 'to pierce the twelve rings In a single arrow's flight' Yet, not a one can string the bow  My veil of silence lifted All is revealed Revenge burns in my heart Thrashing and slashing down all my foes...to claim the throne  Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca I will right all the wrongs Let the Gods sing my song Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca Let a new life begin This is the end of my Odyssey  Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied Home - I'm finally home I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew I have returned to make my dream come true
From whom the Gods destroy they first make madCasting shadows on our fearsMalicious designs built strong and iron-clad catostrophicConclusion, judgement closes near Chaos sets the stageBitter mouths of violent rageSpinning webs of timeless confusionHelp us find our way Tonight can we scape from this hell(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)Conquer the wickedTonight can we escape from ourselves Ten-thousand tyrants preach their treacheryStriking down the weary and the wiseSwords of oppression sever the arteryOf our freedom - victimized Chaos sets the stageBitter mouths of violent rageSpinning webs of timeless confusionHelp us find our way Tonight can we scape from this hell(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)Conquer the wickedTonight can we escape from ourselves Down-cast jaded - the glory has fadedSo close your eyes(locked in the darkness all your life...)Dream a twisted tale - dark and venomous(...do you really have a reason not to fell this raging season)So infamous Watch the raging inferno of serpents rip the fleshFrom all your pride and gloryThen you die open your eyes - it's true [Solo] Chaos sets the stageBitter mouths of violent rageSpinning webs of timeless confusionHelp us find our way Tonight can we scape from this hell(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)Conquer the wickedTonight can we escape from ourselves
Silver cross in ancient halls, deep inside the castle wallsBound to sleep, forever locked in chainsEvil carved into the stone, ancient words they've never knownA serpent's silent shroud still remainsCome with me and I'll make all your wishes come trueLifting the chains of oppression from youWiping away the lines carved in your faceTake the relic from this placeCarry on, into the horizon, wielding courage, staff in handJourney on, through shadows and dreams, and what lies beyond the guardian's keepPrey and siege in voiceless woe, whose dust was scattered long agoAwaken from the dark and endless sleepMan's desires, now mortal wounds, believing tales and shallow truthsHardened hearts now tremble in the keepTrust in me and I'll lay all your nightmares to wasteTake the relic from this placeCarry on, into the horizon, wielding courage, staff in handJourney on, through shadows and dreams, and what lies beyond the guardian's keep
Your eyes singing to me sweet lullabies While you lay there in submission Forbidden desire Alone in the moonlight hearts afire Burn away our inhibitions When the stars lose their fire And night steals the morning away Forever and the day I will stay, I will stay here with you my love Sacrifice a heart beat away from paradise All my reasons given way to temptation Fear and shame Looking for someone else to blame We're devoured by these foolish accusations With every fleeting breath I take Maybe a love was a mistake Eternal life I traded for one moment beside you When the stars lose their fire And night steals the morning away Forever and the day I will stay, I will stay here with you my love When the stars lose their fire And night steals the morning away Forever and the day When the stars lose their fire And night takes the morning away Forever and the day I will stay, I will stay here with you my love
Lurking out of sightNight shall fall and feed my frenzyBeneath an eerie moon a change comes over meEyes glow by candlelightA face divided in the mirrorMy psyche ripped by daggers of my alchemySide by side with myself againAs midnight's curse descends on trembling handsOh, save my soulLosing control when the bells tollSavage on the prowlIn the lamplight's glow, nocturnalMy breath hangs like ghosts in the evening airThis ill effect, a vile creationOf my design, abominationThe madness rages on and onSide by side with myself againAs midnight's curse descends on trembling handsOh, save my soulLosing control when the bells tollOh, feed my soulI'm in control, when the bells toll
Down the place, come hell riders Blood on ice resign breath Consumed by this lust into battle Staring down the lies of dead Skies are mad with thunder With the lightning fire Invaders Like Slayers Calm down the freedom betrayers Dark destroyer Can't avoid or deny us Forever on the dust Bring down the walls of Babylon Legions of lights Beating down the Ma'am Wings of war they pulverize Wrath this my life Feel the hatred Crawling defying store the skies Skies are mad with thunder With the lightning fire Flesh tearing Blood pouring The veils of one are returning With conviction now addiction is king Forever on the dust Bring down the walls of Babylon So you'll right step Beyond the populous God of Pain In evil still Casualty is a pride I will never be a lord A lord of war and war with myself Skies are mad with thunder With the lightning fire Earth shaken Outbreaken The hands of fates annulated One by one the stars are falling Forever on the dust Bring down the walls of Babylon
It was seven score and sixteen moreA dreadful scene to beholdMarble silhouettes, whitestatuettesForever gaze into time(Caught in a web between life and death)Visions dance throughout the nightIn the pale moon lightIn the witching hourHaunting minuet, immortal duetDance to the waltz of the soulsStillness falls upon the aging hallThe fading chimes echo midnight(Caught in a web between life and death, life and death)Visions dance throughout the nightIn the pale moon lightIn the witching hour
Beckoning me through aeons of time - captured by youin dismayI try to elude these prisions of flesh - but return toshattered domainsThere's no image in the mirrorShattered glass impales my soulShe's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my headShe's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning redEnchanting me - defying my love - I'm hindered withpenance and painFalse reflection of grandeur and light - leaves my heartbleeding and stainedThere's no image in the mirrorShattered glass impales my soulShe's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my headShe's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red[solo]She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my headShe's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning redShe's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my headShe's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red

[Instrumental]
I believe, nothing ever comes to light Chasing shadows in the nightIn a starless sky and I wonder whyOh I believe, we will never find a way The darkness lights the dayWe never question why, still I wonder why?I close my eyes lost in the memoryJust like a candle in the windWhat could have been, with just one kiss goodbyeYou spread your wings to flyFar away, somehow, someday you will understandI hope you'll understand, somedaySilent pictures like ghosts in the machineHaunting my reflection in the frameChasing down the hopeful child inside of meWhere'd it all go wrong and who's to blameOh, we pass the time awayWith empty lives, the laughter diesOh! Is the all we have to show?Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way?What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone?Trading futures for a song we gave awayThinking only of myself, I forged aheadNo regrets, no apologiesBitter tears reward the life that I have ledA world of lies brings me to my kneesI took the road with every twist and every turnThe words of wisdom is the lesson never learnedLose your fear and free your soul orThe mysteries of life you'll truly never knowYou'll never know!Is the all we have to show?Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way?What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone?Trading futures for a song we gave awayJust gave it awayI close my eyes, lost in that memoryLike a candle in the windWhat could have been, with just one kiss goodbyeYou spread your wings to fly far awayI hope you'll understand one dayWe pass the time awayWith empty lives, the laughter diesAnd the colors fade, fade awayOh daylight fades awayOh no no no!Oh! Is the all we have to show?Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way?What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone?Trading futures for a song we gave awayWhat went wrong?Where have all our heroes gone?Trade our future for a song,We gave it all away
When all the angels crySadness reigns upon us allWhite doves fade to blackWith the absence of the heartWe could never smileWe can feel the bitter tearsWhispers from you, calling out from aboveVisions I can't see, like the wind and your loveWhispers to you, calling out through the nightWords I can't hear, graceful figure in whiteAnd when you watch over mePlease guide me all the wayYou're my judge and my juryAs I lay my head to restYour absence will surround meAnd I'll die another deathWhispers from you, calling out from aboveVisions I can't see, like the wind and your loveWhispers to you, calling out through the nightWords I can't hear, graceful figure in whiteWhispers from you, calling out from aboveVisions I can't see, like the wind and your loveWhispers to you, calling out through the nightWords I can't hear, graceful figure in white
Alone I traveled through the mountainsLed by a star fading westWhen I came upon an ancient ruin of a churchAnd it was there I stopped to restThen the black and gloomy night that chased my footstepsCrashed down on me like a waveWhispering through the trees and eerie breezeCarried a voice beckoning me to be her slaveIn a whisper she said[Chorus]Burn foreverLeave never from my armsEmbrace the nightFrom the black and twisting shadows rose a womanBeauty alluring to the eyeOh her devilish grin, her moonlit skinAnd long dark hair flowing down around her thighsAs she approached I felt the evil growing strongerI waltz with the wicked withinFrozen in my place, she kissed my faceAnd in a storm of passion bathed me in sinIn the madness, she said,[Chorus]Then she weaved a mist, and cast me into the shadows"Come with me, love eternally, forever mine""Set me free, in death we'll dance eternally forever and ever"As so the light, cast down from the heavens,Washed over me like waveI awoke, it seems, from some crazy dreamOnly to find I was standing at her graveIn my nightmare, she said[Chorus]Burn foreverLeave never from my armsDon't ever leave me, never leave me[Chorus]
