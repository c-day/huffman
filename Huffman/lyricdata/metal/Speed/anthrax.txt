Disease! Disease! Spreading the disease. With some help from Captain Trips, He'll bring the world down to his knees. Power, yes Power! He'll show them all his power. It pulses through his ice cold blood, A whole world to devour! Bridge He's seeing, he's calling, his legacy he's spawning. He's coming, corrupting, among the living! Murder! Murder! Commit cold blooded murder! Like Nazis during World War Two, they only follow orders. Hatred! Hatred! A crucifix is your bed, Once he turns his eye on you, you'll be better off dead! I'm the walkin' dude, I can see all the world! Twist your minds with fear, I'm the man with the power. Among the living, follow me or die! Man, fights Man! Divided they can't stand! United, they can battle back, and make him force his hand! Fear, yes fear! His end is growing near, He didn't count on Man's good faith, And their will to persevere. Follow me or die! Fire! Hot fire! Purge the world with fire!! Damnation is the price he'll pay, for an evil man's desire! Good, versus evil! The stand to vanquish evil! Man can only live one way, that place right in the middle. Follow me or die! Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among Among!

Trapped up inside here, like lions in a cageI've been a mark of injusticeBound by these chainsCan't find a reason, I'm on my ownMy destiny waits for a sign from meI'm leaving alone I'm out on my way nowIt's been so many yearsThe chase is my lifebloodI have no more fears Fire, burns in my veinsAnger, shows on my faceHatred, it poisons my soulLook out, I'm about to explode Evil ones try to destroy usWe're armed and prepared for attackWe'll take on the world with the rebellionWe're dangerous down to the last Armed and dangerous Am I evil, or am I insaneThe lion inside of me, is no longer tameA blade in my left, a gun in my rightTo beat you within, an inch of your life

Standing on some dotted lineReacting to the hands of timeA circumstance that I've been fedLeaving questions in my headFind the space that was left bareAn empty space I'd gladly shareOne must live while one must dieCombined paired up for so many yearsUnsure if I really want to shed a tearSigning off is always so clearly doneA number 2 is now reduced to oneFind the space that was left bareAn empty space I'd gladly shareWhen your clock is upAnd you rest for goodI will cut off my armpieceJust like we agreed we wouldOne must live while one must dieWhile the other argues thatThe world ain't fairBut then who ever promisedAnybody equal shareYou might as well forgetWhat you gambled on'Cause plans never go by the way they're drawnWhen your clock is upAnd you rest for goodI will cut off my armpieceJust like we agreed we wouldOne must live while one must dieI can't say goodbyeIt's all I can do to get up every morningAnd when all else fails I tryTo face myself and everything elseBut mostly I wonder why

Looming large like a favorite sonOne more time comes my obsessionLike a mountain stream that ends in mudI'm wading in waiting for the flood, sinkingYou didLeft me hating, contemplatingLeft me waning, slowly drainingFeet of clay that are stuck to the floorAnd with vanity you want moreI'm drinking strength for comic reliefWhile I'm growing super weak in the kneesYou asked me can I deliverLike a monster crossing the Hudson river, stompingBig fat killCarrying the weight of the worldIn my armsI'm biting my tongue so much it hurtsBut at the same time I'm at a loss for wordsThe things I've seen should've left me blindSo it makes me happy that I'm losing my mind, laughingYou asked me can I deliverLike a monster crossing the Hudson riverThe things I've seen should've left me blindSo it makes me happy that I'm losing my mind
Hardcase  Fist full of brass  Double barrelled pistons and a tank full of gas  He's a heavyweight  Enforcer inside  Like a man in the chair he's gonna go for a ride   Break him  Take him down  Squeeze him, watch him drown   Against lightning  The wind from his sails  Take on a man who's harder than a coffin nail  Priceless, the look on his face  If you look real close you can see the expiration date   Break him  Take him down  Squeeze him, watch him drown   Black Dahlia's in my head   Ice veined  Thousand yard stare  Breaking a man is like hunting for bear  And I'm loaded  Setting the trap  Tighten the noose  And bust a rat with my sap   Break him  Take him down  Squeeze him, watch him drown   Black Dahlia's in my head   Black Dahlia's in my head  Confession's good for the soul  Black Dahlia's in my head  In this hunt I walk alone

Why do I explain myself when everyone'sAn idiot but meI think some people needKilling for stupidity and I'll be born againKicking and screamingAnd dragged back into a lifeLike Ten pounds in a nine pound bagStill I come back to give you somethingThat you never had.Idiot rulesI never fight I only winAnd I don't make emI never bend I only break themFinish my smoke, down my drink, wipe my mouthAnd I just walk awayWhat's the chance of finding somethingReal and make it lastFor that I'd carry all my bags and leaveThem in the pastBecause I spend my life fixing mistakesThat left me scarredAnd when I stand and meet my makerI'll be born again hardDon't judge me by my sins

(Downing, Tipton) You stitch me up good, and you cut me downSo I string you up to keep you hanging aroundYou dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waitingSo I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking We've got to make love, the time is rightWe've got to make love tonight'Cause we're burnin' up You make me greedy, you won't feed me my foodBut I'll make out easy, 'cause I see straight through youYou cool me off and hot me up and that's not right'Cause you'll get hungry in the heat of the night And then we'll make love, just when it's rightAnd when we make love tonightWe'll be burnin' up I know you feel the sameI know you feel the flameStaring deep inside of youBurnin' you up, breaking you downBreakin' you out in a cold sweatAnd as you lose control, of your very soulYour desire takes overYou'll feel the heat swayYou're round to my wayAnd suddenly you'll know that you're burnin' up You stitch me up good, and you cut me downSo I string you up to keep you hanging aroundYou dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waitingSo I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking We've got to make love, the time is rightWe've got to make love tonight'Cause we're burnin' upWe're burnin' up

All these years I've been the hard manAll these years it's been so hard manTo live my life for someone elseIn fear of being honest with myselfI perpetrated a lieJuggling my life with one hand tied behind my backTrying to find, and it had always been mineI'm in, I'm outI'm breaking though the darknessAnd it knocked me overInto the light of an older soul, and I'll never dieCause everything I am is in your eyesAngels in my heart, devils in my eyesI'll live forever in your eyesCrucify my inhibitionsThe first born son he died for my sinsNothing to worry aboutAnd all these years I was the hard manI always knew I'd find myself and proveBecause you told me the truth, it's all I wanted from youMy cathartic dream, a primal screamShedding my skinSomewhere between light and darkI balance what I amAnd I remember everything we said we'd ding a wayLaugh and cry, love and hateAin't no weak link this bond won't breakI put it out there it comes back

Love and hate was in the air, like pollen from a flowerSomewhere in April time, they add another hour I guess I'd better think up a way to spend my timeJust when I'm ready to sit inside, it's summer timeShould I go fishing or get a friend to hang aroundIt's back to summer, back to basics, hang around Getting drunk out on the beach, or playing in a bandAnd getting out of school meant getting out of hand Was this your celebrated summer? Was that your celebrated summer? Then the sun disintegrates between a wall of cloudsI summer where I winter at, and no one is allowed there Do you remember when the first snowfall fellWhen summer barely had a snowball's chance in Hell?

I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trailA starry night, a campfire lightThe coyote call, the howling winds wailSo I ride out to the old sundownI am just a cowboy lonesome on the trailLord, I'm just thinking about a certain femaleThe nights we spent together riding on the rangeLooking back it seems so strangeRoll me over and turn me aroundLet me keep spinning till I hit the groundRoll me over and let me goRunning free with the buffaloI was took in Texas I did not know her nameLord, all these southern girls seem the sameDown below the border in a town in MexicoI got my job busting broncs for the rodeoRoll me over and turn me aroundLet me keep spinning till I hit the groundRoll me over and let me goRiding in the rodeoHere I go!Roll me over and turn me aroundLet me keep spinning till I hit the groundRoll me over and let me goRunning free with the buffaloRoll me over and set me freeThe cowboy's life is the life for me

Riding hard, high in the saddleWinged steed of unwearing flightSweeping through air just like fireSwift of the foot, great of mightHear the screams (Ow!)Feel the biteWe ride with deathTonightHere it comesYou better hideShoot the gunsYou're gonna dieConquering all, spreading terrorHoofs gallop in thunderous poundDevouring the souls of the wretchedTrampling them down to the groundGripping the reins of destructionMade of steel on his handsHolder of forces immortalSlaughtering all in his path

Here comes the biggest assholeThat the whole world has ever seenWatch as things turn to somethingI never meant to beCall it a side effect of my arrested developmentHere with you I'm trapped, out of my elementI tear through all this wreckageYou left when you dropped the bombIs there something worth savingOr do I act like nothing's wrongThe lesser of two equals gives me nothing at allLust and madness murder and mayhemMy whole life's been about playingIt's so surrealMaybe that's why I touch but can't feelSittin' pretty as I sit up straightTrying to find means to an endI move into harms wayI see my face in the mirrorI feel my feet but I can't seem to walk in my shoesWhen it hurts I feel closer to youCloser than you ever knewAnd the bottom line is knowingI will die and the worms will eat meThe bottom line is knowingAin't no one else I can beRunning steady, smile on my face
I have something I can revealI get off on laughingIt's like the biggest orgasmIf you like I'll share it with youWhen you give up yourself, you do it peacefullyThen you feel no plight and you think you're freeGive up yourselfThere goes your chivalryFrom on top of the world, I'll throw you down a ropeHog tied to this life, I'm strapped up tightAnd I won't be no slaveI can't wait to get you backI need you back in my clutchesIf it takes a thousand punchesBy the end you'll be in stitchesClimb up if the noose ain't tiedIt won't disturb you, it's here to serve youUnlock the doubt, you'll find it's out, your Rosetta stoneOr you'll cut the line, and stifle timeSlash your wrist and kiss and kiss your crippled bones
Abandon all hope for those who enter'Cause there ain't too much of that down hereA clouded mist in a darkened tunnelAnd twisted screams are growing nearNow you're down here, you're gonna all stay'Cause the howling furies want to come out and playYou're headed for doom, you'd better prepareCause in this part of the woods almost anything's fair, yeahYou lied and cheated in your miserable lifeYou met your end with a butcher knifeWe laughed when you died, you sit in your graveJust waiting to turn into Satan's slave

I'm wiping the slate spotlessI vow this is your final chanceAlmost all but little faith has been thrown out the windowI promise to sustain my stanceYou've taken everything from the get goAnd you've given nothing in returnYour sadomasochism has reached the ninth inningStill you're puzzled to see I'm concernedStruggling, to come to terms withThis god-awful life that I liveStumbling, but still I tryTo get out from under your gripTransparent in critical momentsYou drop me when your hands aren't fullYou call yourself my closest friendThen you make yourself invisibleMy simmering blood is risingPrimed and ready to explodeGet off your high horse and come to the partyI'll beat you into overloadOnly through your limited viewpointYou think you know how I existEasy to turn my back on the systemHard not to be an atheistBack in the days when promises were madeEquality for allYou go by the word from the man who gives itNever expecting a fallStruggling, to come to terms withThis god-awful life that I liveStumbling, but still I tryTo get out from under your gripTransparent in critical momentsYou drop me when your hands aren't fullYou call yourself my closest friendThen you make yourself invisibleTransparent in critical momentsYou drop me when your hands aren't fullYou call yourself my closest friendThen you make yourself invisibleMake yourself invisible, make yourself invisibleMake yourself invisible, make yourself invisible againBurnI never should've trustedI never should've trustedI'm sickened and disgustedI never should've trustedWhat happened to me?Back in the days when promises were madeEquality for allYou go by the word from the man who gives itNever expecting a fallTransparent in critical momentsYou drop me when your hands aren't fullYou call yourself my closest friendThen you make yourself invisibleTransparent in critical momentsYou drop me when your hands aren't fullYou call yourself my closest friendThen you make yourself invisible
(Brian May) (Scene 1)You say you love me and I hardly know your nameAnd if I say I love you in the candlelightThere's no one but myself to blameBut there's something inside that's turning my mind awayOh how I could love you, if I could let you stay It's late-and I'm bleeding deep insideIt's late-is it just my stickly prideToo late-even now the feeling seems to slip awaySo late-though I'm crying I can't help you but hear you sayIt's late, it's late, it's late but not too late (Scene 2)The way you love me is the sweetest love aroundBut after all this time, the more I'm tryingThe more I seem to let you downNow you tell me you're leavingAnd I just can't believe it's trueOh you know that I can love youThough you know I can't be trueOh you made me love youDon't tell me that we're through It's late-and it's driving me so madIt's late-yes I know but don't try to tell me that it'sToo late-save our love you can't turn out the lightSo late-I've been wrong but I'll learn to be rightIt's late, it's late, it's late but not too late I've been so longYou've been so longWe've been so long trying to work it outI ain't got longYou ain't got longWe've gotta know what this life's all about (Scene 3)You're staring at me with suspicion in your eyeYou say what game are you playing?What's this that your saying?I know that I can't replyIf I take you tonightIs it making my life a lie?Oh you made me wonderDid I live my life alright It's late-but it's time to set me freeIt's late-yes I know but there's no way it has to beToo late-so let the fire take our bodies this nightSo late-so let the waters take our guilt in the tideIt's late, it's late, it's late, it's lateIt's late, it's late, it's lateIt's all too late

I have always been an experiment in terrorAt least I can only kill you onceStanding aloof when I made up my mindReaching, why it's better to be bluntYour walking point through my minefieldYou gotta get outYour on point in my minefieldForever waiting for a road mapSpeak, say something, answer meI left you in a killing boxSketchy's not a name you can pin on myI'll start a revolt with my honestyA piece of you burns every time you likeSo lets start a war, just to see how many die

SmokeLingers 'round your fingersTrain, heave on to EustonDo you think you've madeThe right decision this time?You left your tired family grievingAnd you think they're sad because you're leavingBut did you see the jealousy in the eyesOf the ones who had to stay behind?And do you think you've madeThe right decision this time?You leftYour girlfriend on the platformWith the really ragged notion that you'll returnBut she knows that when he goesHe really goesAnd do you think you've madeThe right decision this time?

There's two kinds, of people in the worldThe outlaws, and the lawmen that prevailThe bounty hunter's job is on the wrong side of the lawIntentions, of the truth and nothing moreBurn 'em, clear the streets as he rides into the townCause the nameless one's gonna have some funHe's gonna bring an outlaw downWasted, it's over quick he's nailed 'em three for threeThen he with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chinHe rides through historyThe jury, in his mind the choices weighThe trials, if you're guilty you're his preyNo judgment otherwise can change the lustThat's in his eyesThe sentence, will be carried out in strideNo name, like a shadow on a moonies nightReal game, He'll be there to upholdJustice, law and orderAnd you'll pay, the highest feeWhen the gunslinger takes his pieceThe money, it's the price you have to payWhen he calls, drop your eyes and look awayThe man has taken life to balance scales of wrong and rightExistence, each day a moral fight.
Rolling down the hill snowballing getting biggerAn explosion in the chamber the hammer from the triggerI seen him get stabbed I watched the blood spill outHe had more cuts than my man Chuck chill out24 is my age 22 is my gaugeWriting rhymes on a page going off in a rageOut on a mission a stolen car missionHad a little problem with the transmission3 on the tree in the middle of the nightI have this steak on my head 'cause I got into a fist fightLife comes in phases take the good with the badYou bought those coins on the street and you got hadIt's all high spirit you know you gotta hear itDon't touch the mic baby don't come near itIt's gonna get you, it's gonna get youIt's gonna get you, it's gonna get youLooking down the barrel of a gunSon of a gun, son of a bitch, getting paid getting richUltra violence running through my headFuzzy navel y'all making me see redRapid fire Louie like Rambo got bulletsI'm a gonna die harder like my kid Bruce WillisDrummond I love girlies waxing and milkingGot more excuses than my man Dave ScilkinPredetermined destiny is who I amYou got your finger on the trigger like the Son of SamI am like Clockwork Orange going off on the townI've got posse bonanza to beat your ass downI'm mad at my desk and I'm writing all curse wordsExpressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse wordsYou're a headless chicken chasin' a sucker free basinLooking for a fist to put your face inGet hip don't slip knuckle heads racism is schism on the serious tip

Written by Sting  No time for the complexities of conversationNo time smiles, no time for knowingNo time for the intricacies of explanationNo time for sharing, even less for showing If I couldI'd slow the whole world downI'd bring it to it's kneesI'd stop it spinning roundBut as it isI'm climbing up an endless wall No time at allNo time this timeNo time at allNo time this time No time for a quick kiss at the railway stationNo time for a suitcase, sandwich and a morning paperOnly time for time tables, calls and transportationNo time to think no time to dare If I couldI'd slow the whole world downI'd bring it to it's kneesI'd stop it spinning roundBut as it isI'm climbing up an endless wall No time at allNo time this timeNo time at allNo time this time If I couldI'd slow the whole world downI'd bring it to it's kneesI'd stop it spinning roundBut as it isI'm climbing up an endless wall No time at allNo time this timeNo time at allNo time this timeNo time at allNo time this timeNo time at allNo time this timeNo time at all No time at all...
I've been choking on the air that you've been giving meIt's all a game to you, to me it's an atrocityAs you add another loop onto my nooseI lose all sense of what is abuse'Cause it's always been a bone of contentionThis game of "what it is that I've done for you"I've given you everything for nothing in returnAnd I'm so tired of bleeding for the respect that I've earnedBecause no, nobody knows, nobody knowsBecause nobody knows anythingI don't know how much generosity that I can takeUntil I leave a trail of bodies lying in my wakeHow many times do I lose my mind 'til I realizeGive me the high hat and you think that I should compromise?

It's difficult for me to get a grip on what you meanWhen you stick your fingers in your ear and create another sceneYou always step into the traps set perfect in your pathBusy going crazy over whose knife's in your backDive inside your blackest stareThe one that's saving do you dateScreaming that you're scaredYou the tallest soulWith the shortest self-esteemPainted as the victimWho's split between the beamsIt doesn't seem to matterIt's nothingDead a dream is dyingIt's nothingBest friend I never hadPlay me to the point of pushing me too far awayI can only say whatever, ambivalent to your gameYou can pretend to the mirror, it's the lie you tell yourselfAnd I won't walk on eggshells that's a dance for someone elseDive inside your blackest stareThe one that's saying do you dareScreaming that you're scaredYou the tallest soulWith the shortest self-esteemPainted as the victimWho's split between the beamsIt doesn't seem to matterIt's nothingDead a dream is dyingIt's nothingBest friend I never had

When you praise my name I'll fulfill your expectationLooking for an answer that'll dignify your prayersWhat remains when your savior becomes human?You feel the legend something sacredYou can't understandBecomes bigger than the man.[Chorus]Pray for help cry out scream for me nowI'm not your superheroPray for help cry ill scream for you nowI'm not your superheroAll my love and hate radiate and become equalsUntouchable enmity has always been my fateMine alone agony destined to suffer.Eternally my story never goes as plannedAnd its bigger than the man[Chorus]Once upon a time I would do anythingFor anyone; at anytimeAnd all I asked for was your faithWas that to much to ask?There is no God there is no kingThere is no saint of broken dreamsThere's only you and truth and soulThe superhero is you own

The plans, of a race gone madA final solution to passAll dreams are taken from their livesNo hope for the young all the old realizeHe is but a solitary manWhose prejudice will spread like a flameThroughout the landHe's enslaving those who will be freeEtching his own name in blackFor all of us to hear and seeA yellow star for those accusedThere's no escape once you've been pinnedA relocation only to confuseAnd all their propaganda to hide the awful truthScreams, in the nightScars so deep that they won't mendScreams, in the nightIn their souls they can't pretendSix million lives on the hands of heads of stateThey followed orders from aboveThen one man when all was lostHe took his life, he'll never pay the priceThey cannot hide or defend or disguiseFor the truth is well known there'll be no alibisJudgment will pass and their fates won't be kindFor the final solution was mass genocide

I got so much trouble on my mindParanoia timeI'm running out of lifeClockwise and the seconds tick wayEach line that cuts my faceCut as each hand moves into placeParanoiaamped and wiredBile black the thoughts that run my headThere's so much to be saidThey're so much living deadWalking corpses shambling through lifeWith nothing in their sightDance on their bones, step in and fightParanoiaAmped and wiredLife and death are fighting for my timeI can't seem to find the timeI want what's mineTime through the clockJust keeps talkingIt just walks any damn placeIt feels like walkin'My mind keeps thinkingClockwise as the seconds tick wayI make my move todayTime and lifelife and timeTo have and hold and sometimes findIt isn't mine, it isn't yoursMan to man I'll fight you for, time and lifeLife and timeOne day I'll get what's mineThrough the persistence of timeLife and death as words they don't mean shitIt's what you do with themAnd how you live with itRaging like a bull inside a cageJust give me a stageWhere this bull can rageParanoiaAmped and wiredLife and death are fighting for my timeI can't seem to find the timeI want what's mineTime through the clock just keeps talkingIt just walks any damn placeIt feels like walkin'My mind keeps thinkingClockwise as the seconds tick awayI make my move todayTime and lifeLife and timeTo have and holdAnd sometimes findIt isn't mine, it isn't yoursMan to man I'll fight you for...Time and lifeLife and timeOne day I'll get what's mineThrough the persistence of timeParanoia's lost its hold onParanoia's lost its hold onParanoia's lost its hold onParanoia's got no hold on meTime don't have nothingTo do with how high you canTime don't got nothingTo do with how high you can countTime and lifeLife and timeTo have and holdAnd sometimes findIt isn't mine, it isn't yoursMan to man I'll fight you forTime and lifeLife and timeOne day I'll get what's mineThrough the persistence of time
Swimming on the surfaceIt's a hell of a lot safer up hereAin't prepared to diveAnd uncover all my darkest fearsThis ain't no covert operationI don't have that much concentrationStaring at the clockAnd my patience is wearing thinOne more down the gulletKeeps me from jumping out of my skinI'm lost in the fog of contradictionI toast to the extrasI drink to them 'cause they don't talk to muchThey fill up space and entertainAnd when I cut 'em loose they don't make a fussThey all add up to zero in my lifeThey're just here to cure boredom for the nightNow sometimes all this leaves me feeling hallowThat's when I take refuge with my pillowI'm not even ready for confessionThat's right
(Young, Young & Scott) Outta my way I'm a-runnin' highTake your chance with me and ya give it a tryAin't no woman in the world I knowCause I ain't looking for overflowBaby I ain't got muchResistance to your touchTake off the high heels and let down your hairParadise ain't far from there I'm gonna walk all over youI'm gonna walk all over youDo anything you want me toI'm gonna walk all over you Reflections on the bedroom wallAnd girl you thought you'd seen it allWe'll rise and fall and light the seaYou're lookin' so good under me I'm gonna walk all over youI'm gonna walk all over youDo anything you want me toI'm gonna walk all over you Moanin' groanin' stereoSaid gimme the stage I'm gonna steal the showLeave on the lace and turn off the lightTonight is gonna be the night I'm gonna walk all over youI'm gonna walk all over youDo anything you want me toI'm gonna walk all over you I'm gonna walk all over you
(written by Gene Simmons), originally performed by KISS  Livin' as you do and I'm watchin' you And you don't really know a-just what to do  You don't really know You don't really know What to do  And I'm standin' here not quite aware And I'm tryin' baby, tryin' not to stare  Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here Yes, everybody else is here Everybody else is here Watchin' you  Ooh, 'cause everybody else is here Yes, everybody else is here Everybody else is here Watchin' us

The mind can atrophySuch mediocrityThings aren't what they seemSometimesAnd every waking dreamRepeating central themeIf we don't wake up do we die?And when the best can beWorse than what's usuallyFound out it's all betweenThe linesThen patience starts to bleedIncreasing enmityIt's time to let the bullets flyDeveloped all exposureRevealing no composureThe gates are open wideThe wrecking ball is hereYour chest contains no treasureThe prisoners are loose'CauseWe've come for you allPay the expected feeFor the insanityNow the reflection's deeplyLinedAll systems fail and seizeBreak down and spill the greaseAggressive tendencies designedDeveloped all exposureRevealing no composureThe gates are open wideThe wrecking ball is hereYour chest contains no treasureThe prisoners are loose'CauseWe've come for you allSoloAnd every elementWill force a consequenseIt takes a slanted state of mindThen patience starts to bleedIncreasing enmityIt's time to let the bullets flyDeveloped all exposureRevealing no composureThe gates are open wideThe wrecking ball is hereYour chest contains no treasureThe prisoners are loose'CauseWe've come for you allYour chest contains no treasureThe prisoners are loose'CauseWe've come for you all
(Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett) Welcome to where time stands stillNo one leaves and no one willMoon is full, never seems to changeJust labeled mentally derangedDream the same thing every nightI see our freedom in my sightNo locked doors, no windows barredNo things to make my brain seem scarred Sleep my friend and you will seeThat dream is my realityThey keep me locked up in this cageCan't they see it's why my brain says rage Sanitarium, leave me beSanitarium, just leave me alone Build my fear of what's out thereAnd cannot breathe the open airWhisper things into my brainAssuring me that i'm insaneThey think our heads are in their handsBut violent use brings violent plansKeep him tied, it makes him wellHe's getting better, can't you tell? No more can they keep us inListen, damn it, we will winThey see it right, they see it wellBut they think this saves us from our hell Sanitarium, leave me beSanitarium, just leave me aloneSanitarium, just leave me alone Fear of living onNatives getting restless nowMutiny in the airGot some death to doMirror stares back hardKill, it's such a friendly wordSeems the only wayFor reaching out again

First in last out overthrownIt's been picked clean to the boneAnd so hard to remember thingsLike when we used to kill our kingsCrusading for hypocrisyUnder our nose the holy bleedCrumbling under its own weightApologies if you relate'CauseYou cannot killWhat doesn't dieLive up to my promiseMy full potential realizedDeath lives right inside your pocketTake him out and have a laughGo and piss your life awayAnother ugly waste of clayAnd up above there's no one homeWhy don't you answer your phone?Reminding me to learn that poemFirst in last out overthrownBecauseA stream of consciousness flows into a river of bloodStem this tide of violenceAs it rises like a flood
(Hetfield, Ulrich) Late at night all systems goYou have come to see the showWe do our best you're the restYou make it real you knowThere is a feeling deep insideThat drives you fuckin' madA feeling of a hammerheadYou need it oh so bad Adrenaline starts to flowYou're thrashing all aroundActing like a maniacWhiplash! Bang your head against the stageLike you never did beforeMake it ring make it bleedMake it really soreIn a frenzied madnessWith your leather and your spikesHeads are bobbing all aroundIt is hot as hell tonight Adrenaline starts to flowYou're thrashing all aroundActing like a maniacWhiplash! Here on stage the Marshall noiseIs piercing through your earsIt kicks your ass kick your faceExploding feeling nearsNow is the time to let it ripTo let it fuckin' looseWe are gathered here to maim and killCause this is what we choose Adrenaline starts to flowYou're thrashing all aroundActing like a maniacWhiplash! The show is throughThe metal is goneIt is time to hit the roadAnother town another gigAgain we will explodeHotel rooms and motorwaysLife out here is rawBut we will never stopWe will never quitCause we are Metallica Adrenaline starts to flowYou're thrashing all aroundActing like a maniacWhiplash!
Close your eyes to the horrorClose your eyes to the painWhen you live in a boxNo one knows your nameLiving in the streetMoms and kids with nothing to setWelfare hotelsWho says there's no place called hellI can't see youI can't hear youYou don't see meYou couldn't be meWho cares winsThere but for the grace of GodThere but for the grace of GodWho cares, who cares, who cares, who caresThere but for the grace of GodThere but for the grace of GodGo you or !Open your eyesYou don't see meYou couldn't be meInvisible could be my nameYour excuses are so lameReal pleas fall on deaf earsLook away when I'm nearFreezing cold in winters heatBurning up can be a treatBlisters breaking on my feetAt least I get a subway seatI can't see youI cant hear youYou don't see meYou couldn't be meWho cares winsThere but for the grace of GodThere but for the grace of GodWho cares, who cares, who cares, who caresThere but for the grace of GodThere but for the grace of GodGo you or !Open your armsYou don't see meYou couldn't be meWho cares winsSelf help and preservationNot now I'm on vacationPriority is youAnd screw all those around youNow's the time for you to shareIndifference you have to careDeep inside you know it's trueHow do I get through to youOpen your eyes to the horrorOpen your eyes to the painWhen you live in a boxNo one knows your name
