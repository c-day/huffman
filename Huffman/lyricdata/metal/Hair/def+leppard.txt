Did you see your friend crying from his eyes todayDid you see him run through the streets and far awayDid you see him run, did you see him fallDid his life flash by at the bedroom doorDid you hear the news it came across the air todaySomeone has been found on the rocks down in the bayDid you see him hide, did you see him crawlDoes his life mean more than it did beforeDid you see that man running through the streets todayDid you catch his face, was it 10538
(Elliott, Collen, Campbell, Savage, Allen) I lost my heart to infatuation You can't cure that with a vaccination A bad blood is pumping through my veins I can't slow down, livin' life in the fast lane  Your body language, it's telepathic I'm caught up in the middle of a two-way traffic Wondering if this is the impossible dream Or whether we could make such a beautiful team  I don't know what to do when I get this feeling I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin' A little white lie that you got to believe in Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than love  Intoxicated 'till I can't feel a thing I feed my thirst on your unchained adrenaline My body's shakin' like a man on the run You blow my mind like sex and machine guns  I got scars and bloody knuckles Diggin' for a diamond in a whole lotta trouble You detonate me like a nuclear bomb Wiped out and sleepin' with the TV on  I don't know what to do when I get this feeling I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin' A little white lie that you got to believe in Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than  Love is love, it ain't always right Make you sweat, keep you up all night Walkin' in with your eyes wide open You're looking out on a lost horizon Always something to knock you over And make you feel like you're getting nowhere If you can't stand up when you're on your knees Then close your eyes and float up to the breeze  I've lost my heart but, hey, you can keep it 'Cause it ain't no good at keeping a secret It's got me doing things that I'd never do Another fine mess that it's gotten me into  I don't know what to do when I get this feeling I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin' A little white lie that you got to believe in Don't know what it is, I don't know what it is  I don't know what to do when I get this feeling I don't know what it is but it stops me breathin' A little white lie that you got to believe in Don't know what it is but it's ten times bigger than love

Beyond the temple There lies a tomb with a king from long ago A traveler from a distant planet Ten thousand years or so The legend tells of an agin' man Whose city he built alone Till the pirates of our western world Tore it down stone by stone The clouds are gettin' heavy As he points unto the sky But with the guidance of his finger He let the lightning fly So don't turn around, don't turn around Lightning don't strike twice Don't turn around, don't turn around Death is a very high price He gathered up his people And he took them underground To the caves of silvery water Where they never could be found The king came to the surface Could not believe what he had found The temple left in ruins His city knocked to the ground He went back to his people Sad news he had to tell The only justice for the king Was to put these men in hell So don't turn around, don't turn around Lightning don't strike twice Don't turn around, don't turn around Death is a very high price His face showing sorrow His heart full of grief His life's work in ruins Destroyed by a thief His people just sit around His children just cry The king's mind is all confused Just wonderin' why The temple split in half And scattered through the desert The dust had risen in the air The race of people had to live in devastation Why wasn't he even there? Message from the gods to gather up his people The kingdom couldn't lose them there That's when all the gods and all are livin' peaceful Just a galaxy away The king rose up from underground To light the darkened sky Red lights, green lights, blue lights flashing It seemed a mile high As it lifted from the ground And soared into the air The king looked at what might have been A world that needed care A storm had risen quickly Across the take of hope Now there's no trace of the king Just a memory carved in stone So don't turn around, don't turn around Lightning don't strike twice Don't turn around, don't turn around Death is a very high price Don't turn around, don't turn around Lightning don't strike twice Don't turn around, don't turn around Death is a very high price
Billy's got a gun, he's on the runConfusion in his mind, the blind leads the blindYeah, Billy's got a gun, he's gonna shoot ya downHe's got evil in his eyes, got a reason to despiseThere's danger in the airCan you feel it in the air?Danger (Such a strange emotion)Can you feel it in the air?Oh he was locked inside a room without a doorHis innocence he suffered forIn a world of black and white, they were wrong and he was rightJust looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come trueHe's going underground to track that danger downOh Billy, why you got that gun?Never give him an even breakGettin' caught is the chance you takeIt could be your last mistake(You could be so helpless)As a bird with a broken wingLike a sheep in a lion's denGonna fall but you won't know whenYou hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wallAnd the ghastly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fallThen a scream rang out like thunder, but the lightning was too lateAs the rain came down on the crimson groundIt was the hand of fateAnd a crowd of people gathered round, but Billy couldn't wait
I heard this line one time 'bout tryin' to save the worldBut have you ever tried to save yourselfA wide-eyed suicide driveRemains a fakeAs if you'd everEver go and make the same mistakeStrung out as the night comes crawlin'Your halo of thorns is fallin'[Chorus]Blood runs coldI feel it in my bonesBut you don't know your time is upBlood runs coldSomebody somewhere is screamin' out the wordsBut do they ever really ease the painI guess what I'm trying to sayIs whose life is it anyway because livin'Living is the best revengeYou can playThis fall from graceI see your faceIt's over[Chorus]From you love was kindResolved left scarred and blindWasted and naked in the wingsDenying twist of fateDemanding Heaven's gateLying in wait above the windStrung out as the night comes crawlin'Your halo of thorns is fallin'[Chorus]Blood runs coldBlood runs cold

I am all destiny, a trade, a grain of sandI take the throat of innocence and leave decayI stain the way for all to seeNo fear, no voice, no reasonIn god no guiding lightWhen all the guilt that's in your headTurns its back and plays for deadYou scorch the earth and torch the skyConscience low with head held highIndulge and multiply and sacrificeAs lack of breath chokes undergroundDivulge degenerate, the darker sideFrom windows watch the screaming skyNo fear, no voice, no reasonIn god no guiding lightWhen all the guilt that's in your headTurns its back and plays for deadYou scorch the earth and torch the skyConscience low with head heldWhen all the guilt that's in your headTurns its back and plays for deadYou scorch the earth and torch the skyConscience low with head held highFrom the truth comes all the shameThe curse of flesh just takes it aimOn hallowed ground and tortured skyWalk in fear with spirits high

The sun that is rising is glistening down on the hill The pool of confusion is silently still The thoughts of another keep runnin' through my mind As I search for the answer, it's never easy to find The prophet stood on the hill and firmly he gripped his sword As the angels of wisdom were singing a heavenly chord So I look back and wonder if I should be asking for more As a traveller in limbo who's washed up onto the wrong shore In the morning when I wake up And the story starts to break up Then it's plain to see What's wrong with me So the curtains they are drawn back And my mind is simply torn back To reality, you see, to me, I'm just a misty dreamer I slipped by the waterslide And I thought I heard my true love screamin' So I opened my eyes and shook my head And I realized I was only dreamin' So close your eyes and drift away Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you Your conscience guided by a light Your memory won't be here tonight The sorrow that eyes are showing Doesn't hide your spirit flowing So close your eyes and drift away Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you Drift away Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you

(J.K., Michael Barbiero, Frank Hannon, Tommy Skeoch) I see him there most ev'ry day, A lonely man and his guitar. In his eyes, I see the pain, All the faces and the places, All the trouble that he'd seen.  There was a time, There was a day, They'd come from miles around. They all knew his name. But day's gone by are gone, Now only memories remain.  Then he starts to play. Suddenly the pain slowly fades away. Tattered, torn and frayed, There's a place within his heart He'll always save for the song and emotion. Know he's got to his dyin' day. Song and emotion. You can hear him play. You can still hear him say, Better run for cover 'cause it looks like rain again!  And now his life is but a shadow of his dreams. The calm is over, been stormin' for years. He turns and leans his shoulder to the wind. Lost again!  All along, on his way to the top, Somehow, somewhere, something was lost. Through it all he knew his only friend was Song and emotion. Know he's got to his dyin' day. Song and emotion.  Where are they now, where are those people who promised him his dreams? Where are they now for this lonely creature on the streets? Broken, humbled by the cold reality. Life at the top ain't always what it seems. Oh, better run for cover, 'cause it looks like rain again. You best be careful of what you dream, Of what you dream!  Song and emotion. Song and emotion. Song and emotion. Song and emotion.

On the first day of the first month in some distant yearThe whole sky froze goldenSome said it was the aftermath of the radium bombWhile the others told of a final retributionA terrible revenge of the GodsBut we understood the grand finaleFulfillment of a prophecy told many years beforeSo all that was left wasAll the women were captured and chainedAnd national suicide was proclaimedAnd new America fell to the groundAnd all the children lay crippled lameBut all the nations came togetherIn fear of the thought of the endNo more would we fight in the streetsNo courage had we to defendWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downEverybody ran as they screamed at the soundWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downEverybody ran as they screamed at the soundA blinding light the sun had died a new moon took its placeTidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman raceThe city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lendA sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the endWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downEverybody ran as they screamed at the soundWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downEverybody ran as they screamed at the soundWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downEverybody ran as they screamed at the soundWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downWhen the walls came tumbling downNobody made a sound(Down, down, down)Down
Could you ever steal a prayer to deny your God Could you ever buy your love and not count the cost Could you ever take a life when all was lost And would it ever be enough Could you bite the hand that feeds you and then ask for more Could you kiss the wound that bleeds spit it on the floor Could you open up your heart then close the door And would it ever be enough Every word you whisper All the tears you hide You die for love when it's alive But where does love go when it dies If you came across your dream would you walk on by Hold a candle to the wind and just let it die And is there room inside your mind for one more try And would it ever be enough I watch the time go rushing by it's like an ocean wave Showing you no mercy throwing dirt upon your grave You're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light And there ain't no prayer that's gonna save you now If you woke up from your sleep blood on your hands Would you wash the pain away no one understands There must be someone out there who can help you breathe again And would it ever be enough
