We met some time ago when we were almost youngIt never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from I didn't have much money so I stole you a roseYou were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothesI never thought I'd lose you,nor I'd rather go blindI thought I saw a future but the fortune teller liedYour love was my salvation it could always get me high What was once holy water tastes like bitter wineI know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes When I was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat The first night I said I love you you told me to go to hellYou were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motelJust like everything good love has to die Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbyeYour love was my salvation it could always get me high What was once holy water tastes like bitter wineJust like everything good love has to die No one even cried we were one of a kindLove left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone byWhat was once holy water tastes like bitter wineYour love was my salvation it could always get me high You take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine

Yo no vi las flores marchitar, Ni ese frio en tus ojos al mirar, No,no vi la realidad Me ibas a dejar. Dicen que la vida baby no es como la ves, Para aprender hay que caer, Para ganar hay que perder, Lo di todo por ti. Llore y llore y jure que no iba a perderte, Trate y trate de negar este amor tantas veces, baby Si mis lagrimas fueron en vano, Si al final yo te ame demasiado, Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado. Cada hora, una eternidad, Cada amanecer, un comenzar; Ilusiones nada mas, Que facil fue sonar. Tantas noches de intimidad Parecian no acabar; Nos dejamos desafiar Y hoy nada es igual. Se que en verdad el amor al final siempre duele, No lo pude salvar y hoy voy a pagarlo con creces, baby Si mis lagrimas fueron en vano, Si al final yo te ame demasiado, Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado. Esta vez la pasion ha ganado Y por eso sigo esperando, Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado. Llore y llore y jure que no iba a perderte, Trate y trate de negar este amor tantas veces, baby Si mis lagrimas fueron en vano, Si al final yo te ame demasiado, Como yo, como yo nadie te ha amado.

R.samboraTheres a danger of getting so close to youThere comes a timeWhen the walls fade awayAnd when love turns to bitter blueSometimes it feels like its so hard to stayLast night we went to bed angryWe didint mean what we saidSeems we never get past forgivenessWe try to hide, we never learnTo swallow our pride.On the down side of loveWhere the love turns to hateWe just cant relateOn the down side of loveWhen youre misunderstoodcause when it hurts youIt hurts you so good.Baby life has no guaranteeNever knowing where loves gonna leadEven through youre a part of meWe have to deal with our pain separatelySometimes we both feel like victimsWith no easy way out not, no, noSomehow we stand by each otherWhen were desperate, and drowning inThe shadows of doubt.On the down side of loveWhere the love turns to hateWe just cant relateOn the down side of lovecause when it hurts youIt hurts you so good.The times we share the tendernessAre the times that keep us aliveYou get in my face, you rough me upBut baby you knowCant hurt me nough, to give you upAnd make me let goMake me let got oh no, no.When youre on the down side of loveWhere the love turns to hareWe just cant relateOn the down side of loveWhen youre misunderstoodcause when it hurts youIt hurts you so good.Downside of loveLoves just a long, long road babyYes theres a down side of loveStand by my side babyWhen youre on the downside of loveNo, no, noDownside of lovecause its a long, long road babyDownside of love.
Day after day I get more confused Trying to see the light In the morning rain Going on a game You have to lose 'Cause the feeling's changed I won't lose again  CHORUS 1 Giving the people As I pray my soul I wanna get lost in rock'n'roll And drift away  Sometimes I think I've always been down I don't understand the things I see The world outside seems so unkind So unkind But I'm dependin' on you to let it See me through  REPEAT CHORUS 1
Across the border they turn water into wineSome say it's the devil's bloodThey're squeezing from the vineSome say it's a saviorIn these hard and desperate timesYou see it helps me to forget that we're just bornTo dieI came here like so many did to find a better lifeTo find my piece of easy streetTo finally be aliveAnd I know nothing good comes easyAll good things take some timeI made my bed I'll lie in itTo die in it's the crimeYou can't help but prosperWhere the streets are paved with goldThey say the oil wells ran deeper here than anybody's knownNow I packed up on my wife and kidAnd left them both back at homeSee there's nothing in this pay dirtThe ghosts are all I knowNow the oil's goneAnd the money's goneAll the jobs are goneStill we're hangin' onDown in dry countyThey're swimming in the sandPraying for some holy waterTo wash the sins from off our handsHere in dry countyThe promise has run dryWhere nobody criesAnd no one's getting out of here alive (Not this time)"In the blessed name of Jesus" I heard a preacher sayThat we are all God's childrenAnd He'd be back, back somedayI hoped that he knew something as he drank that cup of wineI didn't have too good a feeling as I head out to the nightI cursed the sky to openI begged the clouds for rainI prayed all night for waterFor this burning in my veinsIt was like my soul's on fireAnd I had to watch the flamesAll my dreams went up in ashesAnd my future blew awayNow the oil's goneAnd the money's goneAll the jobs are goneStill we're hangin' onDown in dry county They're swimming in the sand Praying for some holy water To wash these sins from off our handsHere in dry county The promise has run dry Where nobody cries And no one's getting out of here alive  Men spend their whole lives waiting Prayin' for some big reward But it seems sometimes the payoff Leaves you feeling like a dirty whore If I could choose the way I'd die Make it by the gun or knife 'Cause the other way there's too much pain Night after night after night after nightDown in dry countyWhere they're swimming in the sand Praying for some holy water To wash the sins from off our handsIn dry county The promise has run dry Where nobody cries No one's getting out of hereDry countyAnd no one's getting out of hereDry county
A whiskey bottle comforts me And tells me not to cry While a full moon says a prayer for me I try to close my eyes But the night's there to remind me Of the guns and the early graves The ghosts appear as I fall asleep To sing an outlaw's serenade Dyin' ain't much of a livin' When you're livin' on the run Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young Is it too late to ask for forgiveness For the things that I have done Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young The desert's been a friend to me It covers me by night And a snakebite's not my enemy But it taught me how to fight All this fame don't bring you freedom Though it wears a this disguise When an outlaw is just a man to me And a man has to die Dyin' ain't much of a livin' When you're livin' on the run Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young Is it too late to ask for forgiveness For the things that I have done Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young And I hope someone will pray for me When it's my turn to die, pray for me Dyin' ain't much of a livin' When you're livin' on the run Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young Is it too late to ask for forgiveness For the things that I have done Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young

In the heat of the street of the city A young boy hides the pain And he walks so tall, trying to hang on But he knows he's going down again I know he's going down...  Darkness fades he's the prince of his city In a place where they all know your name You can see in their eyes life so paralyzed. Your just a pawn in a losin' game You lose at life it ain't no game  Hear their cries The hardest part is the night (In the night, hear their cries, in the night) Stay alive The hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night...  All alone in a place where the lonely They all have to walk through the rain And they dance on the edge where you only Only pray that it has to end That the night ain't no friend  Hear their cries The hardest part is the night (In the night, hear their cries, in the night) Stay alive The hardest part is the night, it's the night, it's the night... (X 2)  These four walls they could tell you some stories About lying and dying and fame There's a price that you pay for the glory About losing and choosing and pain.

I was lost, then I found you.I never thought it would be this way.Showed you my heart, I left it unguarded,Like a thief in the night you stole it away.Now you're gone, the pain goes on and on.I still hear you whispering to me through the shadows of the night.Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.You're running on into a cold night.You're just a number of the love lies.All alone you call it survival,He lost at love to a stranger's lines.Walking the streets, searching with vengenceFor a face that he dreams of night after night.Time goes on, all signs of life stolen, simple dreams were all broken.Best of times become desperation but how many tears must you cry to survive?Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.You're running on into a cold night.Just a number of the love lies.Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines.You're running on into a cold night.Just a number of the love lies.They met late one night in the city.Both men knew only one would stay.Scratched a picture of a heart on a bulletAnd took his life away.Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines.You're running on into a cold night.Just a number of the love lies.Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.You're running on into a cold night.Just a number of the love lies.

As we stood there older than men And younger than the boys (that's right) We were as still as the wind That blows on a hot August night And you were lonesome As a jukebox But deadly just the same I could be as gentle as a newborn Then spit into the eye of a hurricane And we knew how to laugh And we knew how to cry Yeah, we sure knew how to live But we don't ever Never say die Never say die I guess you'd say we had a pact These words we knew so well (that's right) Still they remained unspoken And we'd take them to the fiery Gates of hell Once I was afraid of love But when it's your brother Those things change 'Cause love is just another word For trust So hear me when I say Never say die Never say no You got to look them in the eye And don't let go When it's your own blood you'll bleed And your own tears you'll cry When you're brought up to believe That it's the strong who survive Never say die Yeah, and we could run like lightning Through the pouring rain And we'll be standing like a soldier Who comes marching home again They ask what it is that I want written On the gravestone where I'll lie Tell them it's just my bones That died there So save the tears they'll cry My spirit is still riding somewhere Somewhere in this night When it's these three words that come to me As I kiss this world goodbye Never say die Never say no You got to look them in the eye And don't let go When it's your own blood you'll bleed And your own tears you'll cry When you're brought up to believe That it's the strong who survive Never say die
As I sit in this smokey roomThe night about to endI pass my time with strangersBut this bottle's my only friendRemember when we used to parkOn Butler Street out in the darkRemember when we lost the keysAnd you lost more than that in my backseatRemember how we used to talkAbout busting out, we'd break their heartsTogether, foreverNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeYou and me and my old friendsHoping it would never endNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeHoldin' on, we got to tryHoldin' on to never say goodbyeRemember days of skipping schoolRacing cars and being coolWith a six pack and the radioWe didn't need no place to goRemember at the prom that nightYou and me we had a fightBut the band they played our favorite songAnd I held you in my arms so strongWe danced so closeWe danced so slowAnd I swore I'd never let you goTogether, foreverNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeYou and me and my old friendsHoping it would never endNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeHoldin' on, we got to tryHoldin' on to never say goodbyeI guess you'd say we used to talkAbout busting outWe'd break their heartsTogether, foreverNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeYou and me and my old friendsHoping it would never endNever say goodbye, never say goodbyeHoldin' on, we got to tryHoldin' on to never say goodbye

Long slow drive down an old dirt roadYou've got your hand out the window, listening to the radioThat's where I wanna be...On old park bench in the middle of DecemberCold hard rain fallin', can't find no coverThat would be alright with me...Hard days, good times, blue skies, dark nightsBaby, I want you to take me... wherever you're going toMaybe, say that you'll save me... a seat next to youIn the corner booth of a downtown bar, with your head on my shoulderSmokin' on a cheap cigar... that would be alright with meIn the back row of a movie or a cross-town trainI wanna hear your voice whispering my name... that's where I wanna beHard days, good times, blue skies, dark nightsBaby, say that you'll take me... wherever you're going toMaybe, say that you'll save me... a seat next to youLife is like a ferris wheel, spinnin' aroundWhen you get to the top it's hard to look downJust hang on ... we'll make it throughSave me ... a seat next to youWhen you get to the gates and the angels singGo to that place where the church bells ringYou know I'll come runnin'... runnin' to find youBaby, say that you'll take me... wherever you're going toMaybe, I want you to save me... a seat next to youA seat next to youA seat next to youA seat next to you

Shot through the heart it's all part of the game we call loveWould you be content to see me cryingAfter all those little games you put me through?After all I've done for you you're lyingWouldn't it be nice to tell the truth?Didn't somebody somewhere sayYou're gonna take a fall?I gave you everythingNow here's the curtain callShot through the heart as I lay there alone in the darkThrough the heart it's all part of the game we call loveNow you've come back here to say you're sorryBut I just don't know who you're talking toIt could be the man I used to be, girlBut I've grown up and now I'm over youStanding there just a livewireWith nowhere left to turnYou were gonna set the world on fireWhen will you ever learn?Shot through the heart as I lay there alone in the darkThrough the heart it's all part of the game we call loveDidn't somebody somewhere sayYou're heading for a fall?I gave you everythingNow here's the curtain callAnd I'm shotBaby does what baby pleaseAnd baby must have what she seesBut not this time the tables turnedBaby, you just got burnedShot through the heart as I lay there alone in the darkThrough the heart it's all part of the game we call love

Happiness, it's been no friend to meBut forever after ain't what it's all cracked up to beYeah, I had a taste, you were my fantasyBut I lost my faith when I hit realityI don't need no Guru to tell me what to doWhen your feeling like a headline onYesterday's newsCome on, come on, come onGive me something for the painGive me something for the bluesGive me something for the pain whenI feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's nooseGive me something I can useTo get me through the nightMake me feel all right,Something like youLoneliness has found a home in meMy suitcase and guitar are my only familyI've tried to need someone, like they needed meI opened up my heart, but all I did was bleedI don't need no lover, just to get screwedThey don't make a bandage, that's going to cover my bruiseCome on, come on, come onGive me something for the painGive me something for the bluesGive me something for the pain whenI feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's nooseGive me something I can useTo get me through the nightMake me feel all right,Something like youPull me under (Help I'm falling)Run through my veins (Night is calling)To a place (Feels like I'm flying)Where I feel no pain (Christ I'm dying)Be the pillow under my headCover me when I'm in your bedTake me higher than I've ever beenTake me down and back againCome to me, be my disguiseOpen your coat, let me crawl insideCome on, come on, come onCome on, come on, come onGive me something for the painGive me something for the bluesGive me something for the pain whenI feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's nooseGive me something I can useTo get me through the nightMake me feel all right,Something like you
I lost all faith in my God, in his religion tooI told the angels they could sing their songs to someone newI lost all trust in my friendsI watched my heart turn to stoneI thought that I was left to walk this wicked world aloneTonight I'll dust myself offTonight I'll suck my gut inI'll face the night and I'll pretendI got something to believe inAnd I had lost touch with reasonI watched life criticize the truthBeen waiting for a miracleI know you have tooThough I know I won't winI'll take this one on the chinWe'll raise a toast and I'll pretendI got something to believe inIf I don't believe in Jesus, how can I believe the PopeIf I don't believe in heroin, how can I believe in dopeIf there's nothing but survival, how can I believe in sinIn a world that gives you nothingWe need something to believe inIf I don't believe in Jesus, how can I believe the PopeIf I don't believe in heroin, how can I believe in dopeIf there's nothing but survival, how can I believe in sinIn a world that gives you nothingWe need something to believe in
I thought miracles were make believeIt's hard to hold what you can't seeI find the faith I needEvery morning when you wake up next to meIf all the shit we take for grantedTook our train and left us strandedLet's make a stand and wave goodbyeEach night I see the world through brand new eyesIn my heart I hear the music playingCan you hear it?Take my handWe can danceTo the laughter, to the tearsWe can danceTo all those wasted years that disappearedHey, they got us hereTake my handWe can danceFor the good fight and the badFor the dreams that we still haveLooking back on it all, babyWe're still standing hereTake my handWe can danceBaby, lay down next to meI want to feel each breath you breatheIn your kiss I taste the truthI wanna get all tangled up in youIn your heart I heart the music playingI can hear itTake my handWe can danceWith the laughter, with the tearsWe can danceWith all those wasted years that disappearedHell, they got us hereTake my handWe can danceWith the good fight and the badWith the dreams that we still haveLooking back on it all, babyWe're still standing hereTake my handWe can danceAnd when the song is overWe'll still be going on.Chorus
J. bon joviYou think you know me just because you know my nameYou think you see me cause youve seen every line on my faceYou want to want me just beacause I say that I want youBut does it matter if anything Im saying is the truthYou need somebody, somebody to hold on toBut this aint the movies and we aint heroesStaring at your window with a suitcase in my handThe streetlights buzz as the cars roll by and the moon dont give a damnMy boots just keep on walkin, but my heart dont understandWhy Im staring at your window with a suitcase in my handI said I want you, but when we woke up one of us was cryingYou rolled over and all you said was -Man, I think Im dyingOur song is over, this band of gold has been feeling like a nooseYou place your bets, cause no one thinks theyll loseStaring at your window with a suitcase in my handThe streetlights buzz as the cars roll by and the moon dont give a damnMy boots just keep on walkin, but my heart dont understandWhy Im staring at your window...The light of love can blind you til you cover up your eyesAnd you try to find the reason not to say goodbyeIts the curse of every sailor standing on dry landStaring at your window with a suitcase in my handThe night is fading, like my old tattooA heart and a dagger, that says foreverStaring at your window with a suitcase in my handThe streetlights buzz as the cars roll by and the moon dont give a damnIm getting tired of talkin, even I dont understandWhy Im staring at your window with a suitcase in my hand

It's pretty cold for late SeptemberThe autumn wind is creeping inThe summer sun packed up it's long goneThere's a whole lot of leaving going on, yeah I'll bet it's warm in CaliforniaI think it's time to hit the roadI just might call that band of gypsiesGo searching for our pot of goldSeems like lately there's a whole lotta leaving goin' on I close my eyes and picture your hand in mineI still hear your voice, it takes me back to that timeWell I can find a reason to be strongSeems like lately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on Close the window, draw the curtainsYou ain't the only one here hurtinNo one's right, no one's wrongLately there's a whole lot of leavin' goin' on
