Ricky was a young boyHe had a heart of stoneLived 9 to 5 and worked hisFingers to the boneJust barely out of schoolCame from the edge of townFought like a switchbladeSo no one could take him downHe had no money, oohNo good at homeHe walked the streets a soldierAnd he fought the world aloneAnd now it's[Chorus]Eighteen and life you got itEighteen and life you knowYour crime is time and it'sEighteen and life to goEighteen and life you got itEighteen and life you knowYour crime is time and it'sEighteen and life to goTequila in his heartbeatHis veins burned gasolineIt kept his motor runnin'But he never kept it cleanThey say he loved adventureRicky's the wild onHe married troubleHad a courtship with a gunBang, bang!  Shoot 'em upthe party never endsYou can't think of dyingWhen the bottle's your best friendAnd now it's[Chorus]"Accidents will happen"They all heard Ricky sayHe fired his six-shot to the windThat child blew a child away[Chorus]
Give me a minute 'cause I'm wrapped in superstitionPour me a chemical to take away the edgeDon't make up anything that's breaking all your fingersJust slap around a bit of what it takes to pledgeCarry out another stone as a slaveAsk general-know-it-all, who's juggling the earth?Tease all the natives that will walk across your graveAnd shove aside your nation all for what it's worthBeat yourself blind [Repeat x6]An open eyes and a closed mindLook at the suit in suspended animationA faded outline that used to be a manA piece of paper that's fallen out a windowHas got a better chance to know where it will landTo bleed in vain, to bleed in vain, under my eyes are painted skiesDown at the bone yard, they're diggin' up the relicsHandfuls of parasites thrown into machinesI got the phone call they're tearin' down the missionThe zombies had a ball, but don't know what it meansBeat yourself blind

Is there a problem? The laugh of the rich manHas got you crying poorAre you as heavy as hell in a handbagOr just a virgin whore?If the weight of the world is on your shouldersThen carry it for a dayDo you cry for peace or peace of mind;Is reality in the way?Enter the martyr out through the in doorThe savior has arrived?Is all your anger force of habitAnd keeping you alive?An empty shotgun shooting your mouth offSomething's on your mindThe cheap messiah of persecutionIs alive and doing fineI won't leave if you stay, I don't buy what you sayIf you're a new God let me see a miracleI won't leave if you stay, I don't buy what you sayI can't say that you're a fool,but if you're a new God let me see a miracle.
As the day breaks through the doorwayAnd I'm still chained to this houseBut you call me and I followAnd act like I'm so proudStill reading the sidewalkAnd it smells like morning newsAnd I don't know whyI still can't seem to pull away from youWatch the window time means nothingWatch the window til I see you comingBorn a beggar, will you everSee me more than Pavlovs hungry dog See no colors, live anotherDay to feed on everything you areOn everything you areWhen the day sleeps and the sunshineNo longer burns my eyesAnd the sound of your footstepsIs the only thing that liesBetween me and the feelingThat life is these four wallsThat cage me completelyJust waiting on your callWatch the window time means nothingWatch the window til I see you comingBorn a beggar, will you everSee me more than Pavlovs hungry dog See no colors, live anotherDay to feed on everything you areOn everything you areI run for you and fall so hardMy secrets are buried in the yardBorn a beggar, will you everSee me more than Pavlovs hungry dog See no colors, live anotherDay to feed on everything you areBorn a beggar, will you everSee me more than Pavlovs hungry dog See no colors, live anotherDay to feed on everything you areOn everything you areOn everything you areOn everything you are

Building shrines to gods you'll never knowPraying for rain, settling for snowSpinning out of times to beats impairedDo you know your name, do you even careCan you live your lifeStaring at the lightsNaked on the iceIf it comes too fastWill you get it backWhen it all goes blackDown, goin' down, goin down fromDown from undergroundIcons that you hail are all mechanicalFeeling the pull lost in the foldDigging through a hole of discontentWhat did you learn or did you forgetCan you live your lifeStaring at the lightsNaked on the iceIf it comes too fastWill you get it backWhen it all goes blackDown, goin' down, goin down fromDown from undergroundDown, goin' down, goin' down fromDown from undergroundAnd just what should real life beWhy don't you show me the fiction of realityThis so called life that I seeAnd just what real life should beCan't be what you have shown meIf it comes too fastWill you get it backWhen it all goes blackDown, goin' down, goin down fromDown from undergroundDown, goin' down, goin' down fromDown from underground
There are things we cannot see that hangWithin her sightThere are people we won't remember thatDance with her at nightEileen's calling meTo sit awhile and talk to treesEileen can't you seeThe songs you sing are scaring meEileen, EileenShe romances with the moonFull and aloneIt's really a street lightIt's something we all know
How can I see tomorrow if you keep me in the darkWhen will I see forever if you damn me from the startThere must be a way to get through to yourBlackened heartYou build a wall inside a wall and there's no doorLay your body by the waterPress your face against my soulWading through all your convictionsWe can come in from the coldSearching greener pastures, finding desert sandsCycles on the treadmill turn up empty handsDo I have to bloodlet just to get another chanceInside of you there's a view that sees me there
Sailing ships go through my mindPast wreckage on the wayGlory seekers fall in lineGetting closerSummer laugh, some will cryWhat will summer bring!Some will take her by the reinsAnd ride the sufferingOn a carousel through my yesterdaysDoubt sees the obstaclesFaith sees the wayAll the ways you kill meThey've begun to thrill meNothing there fulfills my firesignBrotherhood betrayal,Sabotage to no availNothing there can kill my firesignBeaten, burned, I'll take the fallAnd get up right in your faceWalk all over what I believeBut I'm still here, you disappearWithout a traceNo need to follow, no need to leadNo need to beg or borrowI just need to be me

As I stare into the fireAll my thoughts go up in flamesHere I stare into the fireI'll be waiting on the rainThe box I keep myself in, closes out my airSo I build a fire, so I can sit and stareCan it be I'm frozenCan it be I'm frozenCan it be I'm frozenCan it be I'm frozenAs I stare into the weatherMy eyes drying from the coldAs I stare into the weatherI sense my thoughts growing oldI listen to the prophets predict the stem of tidesI stare into the weather that's keeping me insideAs I stare into the fireWill the prophets change my mindWhile I stare into the fireAll the colors treat me kindI'll dust away the fallings the winter leaves for meI'll stare into the fire and set tomorrow free

In a darkened roomBeyond the reach of God's faithLies the wounded, the shattered remains of love betrayedAnd the innocence of a child is bought and soldIn the name of the damnedThe rage of the angels left silent and coldForgive me please for I know not what I doHow can I keep inside the hurt I know is trueTell me when a kiss of love becomes a lieThat bears the scar of sin too deepTo hide behind this fear of running unto youPlease let there be lightIn a darkened roomAll the precious times have been put to rest againAnd the smile of the dawnBrings tainted lust singing my requiemCan I face the day when I'm tortured in my trustAnd watch the crystallizeWhile my salvation it crumbles to dustWhy can't I steer the ship before it hits the stormI've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shoreTell me when a kiss of love becomes a lieThat bears the scar of sin too deepTo hide behind this fear of running unto youPlease let there be lightIn a darkened room

Slowly I heal the love that's found its wayOnto another path in times of changeCrossing a bridge unknownHoping our strength will holdShould they both let go then let me layLet me layShow me a signTo a light that shinesOne direction into anotherSheltered peace of mindSomewhere I lost a piece of memorySomehow I know my legs will carry meSearching for circles endHoping the wounds will mendShould this scar, then it was meant to be
Life comes and goes, quick as does the dayGreed, for those who know is just a step awayTime's a breathing bomb, going with the flowStand atop it all outside the status quoNo see, no speak then know where you're goin'Drag your feet then nothing you're showin'Take your place or fall to the lionsLose your face and stand where you're dyingLiving in a hole is taking its tollMy iron will's in positionSeize you are not owed, stand or fallAnd refuse to be deniedPride is all in vain without the blood of needBones can break in shame from taking charityHide from all the hell and wash up with the tideWait and you commit psychological suicideBreak the molds of beg and submissionWake the dead or no one will listenHolding ground is just the beginningIt's uphill bound and in for the killing

She caught the melting skyIt burned but still the winter passes by and byTo the other sideA slow parade of windThat blows through treesThat wilted with the season's childrenAre we saved by the words of bastard saintsDo we live in fear or faithTell me now who's behind the rainA maze of tangled graceThe symptoms of "for real" are crumbling from embraceBut still we chase the shadows of beliefAnd new religion clouds our visions of the roots of our soulsAre we ashamed of our own fateOr play the fool for our own sakeTell me who's behind the rainWhat do we need where do we goWhen we get where we don't knowWhy should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snowWhen faith's our shelter from the coldQuicksand Jesus I'm so far away without youQuicksand Jesus I need youQuicksand Jesus I believe youQuicksand Jesus I'm so far away

Since I was born they couldn't hold me downAnother misfit kid, another burned-out townNever played by the rules, I never really caredMy nasty reputation takes me everywhereI look and see it's not only meSo many others have stood where I standWe are the young, so raise your handsThey call us problem childWe spend our lives on trialWe walk an endless mileWe are the youth gone wildWe stand and we won't fallWe're one and one for allThe writing's on the wallWe are the youth gone wildBoss screamin' in my ear about Who I'm supposed to beGetcha a 3-piece wall street smile And son you'll look just like meI said "Hey man, there's something That you oughta know.  I'll tell ya Park Avenue leads to Skid Row."I look and see it's not only meWe're standin' tall, ain't never a doubtWe are the young, so shout it outThey call us problem childWe spend our lives on trialWe walk an endless mileWe are the youth gone wildWe stand up, we won't fallWe're one and one for allThe writing's on the wallWe are the youth gone wildThey call us problem childWe spend our lives on trialWe walk an endless mileWe are the youth gone wildWe stand up, we won't fallWe're one and one for all The writing's on the wallWe are the youth gone wildWe are the youth gone wild
