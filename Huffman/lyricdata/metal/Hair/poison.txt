He swears he'll love you by candlelightAnd for a while things seem all rightAnd for a moment he hidesThe devil that lies inside And then one night in a fit of rageThe demon raises his hand in hateAnd brings it down on youThere is nothing you can do And then one night in a twist of fateThe angels bring your face to meI cannot erase the memoriesOf you lying there looking up at me ChorusPlease take the demon from my headWon't you please erase the memoriesAnd ghosts who haunt my bedI just want you to understandThat I'm gonna be the only manTo ever touch your soulAnd I ain't never letting go There's a room that lies down the hallWhere you sit and write you poemsOf love and mysteryOf faith and fantasy And you keep a secret lover thereAnd a book beside an easy chairThat you read before you go to bedTo hide the memories in your head And now I try to understand the painYou struggle for the words to sayIt don't come out rightAs you lay your body down Chorus There's a place where you goI've been, I'll never knowThe pain you keep insideThe secrets that you hide But I try to understand your painAnd be a shelter from the falling rainJust maybe I feel what you're going throughMaybe I have been there too Please take the demons from my headWon't you please take the demons from my head(I shall try)Repeat
