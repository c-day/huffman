Ten minutes ago I saw youI looked up when you walked through the door.My head started reeling,You gave me the feeling The room had no ceiling or floor.Ten minutes ago I met youAnd we murmured our how-do-you-do's.I wanted to ring out the bellsAnd fling out my armsAnd to sing out the news. I have found her, she's an angelWith the dust of the stars in her eyes.We are dancing, We are flying, And she's bringing me back to the skies.In the wings of my love Im flyingOver mountain and meadow and glen.And I like it so wellThat for all I can tellI may never come down again. I may never come down to earth again.

I look into the mirrorCan almost count the yearsThe memories are clearerOf all those things I fearedI watch the time pass slowlyIt comes and goes like the wavesThe sea can touch the sky at nightIt's got the freedom I craveI'm going through changes in my lifeI'm going through changesIt'll be alrightLook into a pictureA thousand years are toldNow is it any wonderWhat our tomorrows holdOur yesterdays are overYou know they go so fastIf I could rule the winds of changeYou know I'd make it all lastI'm going through changes in my lifeI'm going through changesIt'll be alrightAlrightI walked alone through the blackest nightI felt the cold, I felt the biteI took the high road but it ain't rightIt's just the low road in disguiseI'm going through changesAh yeaEverything's gonna be alright, yeaGot to the top of an uphill climbOnly to look down the other sideJust when you think it's on your sideThis world will show you ain't no reason to the rhymeI'm going through changesAh yeaEverything's gonna be alrightTimes keep a changing every dayWatch out now cause it's heading your wayAh yeaSeems like the world turned upside downSeems like everything's falling downBut it's all getting better every dayWatch out now cause a good times heading our wayAh, every dayEvery dayEvery dayEvery dayEvery dayEvery day
