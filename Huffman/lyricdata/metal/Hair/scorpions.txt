In a run down bed and breakfastA room with a view, across the riverI tried to loos the claustrophobiaOpened up and find UtopiaThere's no more denyingAs my mind go flyingTen light years away to save my soulTen light years away to change it allWhatever it may take I gotta try againGirl it's time to start overTen light years awayI'd been watching the reflectionOf a bamboo in the shade, when I saw herA very hot day in HavanaIn a midnight blue lagoonI knew she was hidingTen light years away so take me homeTen light years away to change it allHelp me find today It's been way too longGirl it's time to start overTen light years awayThere's no more denyingAs my mind go flyingTen light years away to save my soulTen light years away to change it allWhatever it may take I gotta try againGirl it's time to start overTen light years away so take me homeTen light years away to change it allHelp me find today It's been way too longGirl it's time to start overTen light years away
Music: Herman RarebellLyrics: Klaus Meine Stranded in this townMy machine slows downTo take me where the night beginsI'm playing everywhereLoving here and thereI always take the chance to winDrove a million milesGambling rules my lifeI only stop to start again I reach out through the airGood look is everywhereCan almost touch it with my hands Just a little luck tonightWill do and dreams come trueJust a little luck tonightI can't stop the wheelThat turns the ball of steel When passion rules the gameI ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames I'm a stranger in this townLife takes me up and downI'll break the score until I'm freeCan't stop to roll the diceAnd in the morning lightA girl like you is all I need Don't you need some love tonightI do, yes I doDon't you need some love tonightHow can we stand the heatWhen love is all we need When passion rules the gameI ain't got no control, when my heart's in flames

When the daylight is falling down into the nightAnd the sharks try to cut a big piece out of lifeIt feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrillBut it's more like spinning wheels of fortuneWhich never stand stillBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsWhen the sunlight is rising up in my eyesAnd the long night has left me back at somebody's sideIt feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours beforeBut it's more like looking out for somethingI can't find anymoreBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsAlways yearningThere is no dreamThat you can't make true, if you're looking for loveBut there's no girlWho's burning the ice away from my heartMaybe tonight!Big city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsAlways yearningBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsAlways yearning

I get up in the morningFor my dose of the newsCrawl right back in the sack girlHad enough of the truthSpend your dollars and rubelsBuy a piece of the wallBuild it up in your backyardI'm so sick of it all Ooh, it's a crazy worldOoh, it's a crazy world Drivin' down to the cityDoin' 155Better late than neverI'm more dead than aliveWe can find the TitanicPut a man on the moonBut we can't fix out backyardMan we better start soon Ooh, it's a crazy worldOoh, it's a crazy worldOoh, it's a crazy worldOoh, it's a crazy worldI don't want to hear about itI wish it would be worlds awayYou know the more I think about itThe more I feel we need to changeI get up (In a crazy, crazy world)We all live (In a crazy, crazy world)Ooh yeah (It's a crazy, crazy world)I gotta get out (Of this crazy, crazy world) Goin' home to my babyIt's been another hard dayBust my balls for the tax manSo what else can I sayThey spent our money on missilesFor the third world warNow they're stacked in my backyardWe don't need them no more Ooh, it's a crazy worldOoh, it's a crazy worldOoh, it's a crazy worldOoh, it's a crazy world
It seems to me a nightmare becomes realityThe last days of the paradise are gone for you and meWe're living in the crossfireAnd we'll be killed at firstWhy cannot people that we made the leaders of the worldUnderstand that we don't want to fightUnderstand that we are mush too young to dieUnderstand no one will surviveUnderstand that we love our lifeCan I trust the meaning of the life line in my handWhich is as long as exciting hundred yearsI could be a lucky manBut I'm living in the crossfireOf a time that starts to burnWhy cannot people that we made the leaders of the worldUnderstand that we don't want to fightUnderstand that we are mush too young to dieUnderstand no one will surviveUnderstand that we love our life
Force yourself to use your brain,The only way to gain,A lot of things are just a lie.This world we love comes down in painWith hate and bloody gamesA question-mark up in the sky.Look, you can't keep awayAnd you can't hideTomorrow, yesterday, today ...Some people say, we'll do it betterSome people say, everything's goodSome people sing, let's come togetherBut nobody has ever brought it throughMaybe you and me ...

Life is empty, can't remember anytime before,On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore,Gliding through this life, and another is a child,And we're doing games, and losing things,Always playing gigs.Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright,Where the sun is shining, in the night.I am in disgrace, yet I see a smiling face,And I hope you let me, share your place.I don't live today.Rain in the sky , make the world fly,Into time, beg me your time.Sun in the sky, make the world fly,Into time, beg me your time.Rain in the sky , make the world fly,Into time, beg me your time.Sun in the sky, make the world fly,Into time, beg me your time.Rain in the sky , make the world fly,Into time, beg me your time.Sun in the sky, make the world fly,Into time, beg me your time.Well, I lived in magic solitudeOf cloudy-looking mountainsAnd a lake made out of crystal raindrops Roaming through Space ten thousand years agoI've seen the giant city of AtlantisSinking to eternal waves of darkness Somewhere in the blue distanceAre those long-forgotten trees of yoreA broken violin floating alone in DecemberDarkness everywhere and nothing more.Symbol, strange Symbol, MelancholyPainting torrid colors to a sky of greenCandle breathing one night onlyFar away, in chillness, bleak, unseenDrifting galley, ghostlike shadow,Sails rigged to catch and kill the TimeEchoes wandering down an endless meadowTo call the Thing Sublime!
A G-string is looking for a pilot White flesh is coming down the stairs again Your look just makes me a believer Stray cats are landing in a rain storm Crashed down lost in wango tango land Spaced out your body gives me fever You sex it Relax it Reload it You want it freshly squeezed Closed down the road of all restrictions Mad dogs are tearing down the roof again Sweet noise is pouring from the speakers Last dance I'm drowning in the moonlight Exit is the door that I can't find Black out it can't get it any deeper You sex it Relax it Reload it And never hold it You slash it Refresh it Reload it You want it fresh Got no diamonds rings But a song to sing Just to make you fly Beggar or a king

I don't know Let me walk, let me walk in your heart!

Leaves are falling from the treesMore than anything I want to beClose to you back in your armsI swear I'm still in loveDon't say a word just waitAs the bell will ring across the street we knowThose memories never goLeaves are falling from the skyWhy don't we give it just another tryWhen the winter comes alongThe shadows will be goneThe ice will melt away'Cause in front of the old fireplace is warmOooh, welcome homeLet me take you back againTo a love that's got a nameFor you and meAnother day another chanceOnly love will kill the painThat hurts so deepDon't waste a moment of your life'Cause it's just a kiss of borrowed timeLet me take you back againTo a love that's got a nameFor you and meAnother day another chanceOnly love will kill the painThat hurts so deepAnd we taste that wineJust another sip of borrowed time

She's knocking at my doorThat little angel knows the scoreShe's knocking at my doorBut I won't let her out no moreI want a piece of that pieShe's driving me completely wildShe's giving me a private danceShe's playing with my confidenceThe way she's coming down the stairsMakes me surrender just right thereThis girl is out of this worldHeaven must be a place on earthShe's knocking at my doorThat little angel knows the scoreShe's knocking at my doorBut I won't let her out no moreShe's like a shot of adrenalineShe made me fly with broken wingsWith nothing but the radio onHer body is the song I wantShe's knocking at my doorThat little angel knows the scoreShe's knocking at my doorBut I won't let her out no moreThe light is on but no one's home tonightWe lock the door, we turn the keyAnd throw it right outsideCome on and set me freeIf you had candy once beforeFor you keep coming back for moreShe's got the sweetest touch of allThe longest legs that I recallBefore she leaves she turns aroundThe elevator takes her downShe says oh well the city rocksI go to sleep but then it knocksShe's knocking at my doorThat little angel knows the scoreShe's knocking at my doorBut I won't let her out no more
Another bloody MondayThirty-nine just diedAll hell breaks loose in the crowdA hopeless helter skelterAnother mindless crimeSome corner of the world is burning downHeading for a nervous breakdownCan't take it anymoreI see the fear explode just likeA thousand nights beforeThe ship of foolsKeeps on rollin' through a deadly stormIt won't take long 'till we collideThe ship of foolsKeeps on following the siren's callDamned to be sacrificedCorrupt politiciansPromise paradiseThe thieves are reaching out for the crownViolence is a killerThreatens all our livesJudgment day has come here and nowHeading for a nervous breakdownCan't take it anymoreI see the fear explode just likeA thousand nights beforeThe ship of foolsKeeps on rollin' through a deadly stormIt won't take long 'till we collideThe ship of foolsKeeps on following the siren's callDamned to be sacrificedHeading for a nervous breakdownCan't take it anymoreI see the fear explode just likeA thousand nights beforeThe ship of foolsKeeps on rollin' through a deadly stormIt won't take long 'till we collideThe ship of foolsKeeps on following the siren's callDamned to be sacrificedThe ship of foolsKeeps on rollin' through a deadly stormIt won't take long 'till we collideThe ship of foolsKeeps on following the siren's callDamned to be sacrificed

Dark night, there is no light In the realm of the black magic man Soul's flight into the cold blight Of the destroyer's magic land Poor man, whose spirits are stronger They're the ones who will reign You're struggles are in vain Blind man, you're suckin' your own blood Soon black magic's dying You'd better start crying Blind man, you're suckin' your own blood Soon black magic's dying You'd better start crying Throw out your evil desire The dark king's kingdom is Made out of mire Throw out your evil desire The dark king's kingdom is Made out of mire Keep on for the kingdom of light There is no darkness, there is no night
I remember when my teacher said,"How you want to make your life?"I said, "I can play guitarAnd it will be alright   listen!"When I came out of schoolThey said, "Which way you want to go?"But there was no way strong enoughCompared with rock 'n rollTo get the same thrillAnyhow I've found a jobThey tried to break me with their rulesBut they had no chance at all'Cause I knew what to doTo get the same thrill like rock 'n rollI had a feeling they couldn't buyStill got that feeling they still can't buy,They still can't buy,They still can't buyTell me the alternativeTo what I'm doing, but I guessThere's no other way of lifeWhich is strong like thisTo get the same thrill like rock 'n roll
The job is done and I go outAnother boring dayI leave it all behind me nowSo many worlds awayI meet my girl, she's dressed to killAnd all we gonna doIs walk around to catch the thrillOn streets we call the zooWe eat the night, we drink the timeMake our dreams come trueAnd hungry eyes are passing byOn streets we call the zooWe eat the night, we drink the timeMake our dreams come trueAnd hungry eyes are passing byOn streets we call the zooEnjoy the zooAnd walk down 42nd StreetYou want to be excited tooAnd you will feel the heatWe eat the night, we drink the timeMake our dreams come trueAnd hungry eyes are passing byOn streets we call the zoo We eat the night, we drink the timeMake our dreams come trueAnd hungry eyes are passing byOn streets we call the zoo

Leaving through the back doorFreezing in the coldCommunication breakdownEmotional overloadBeen through a wall of fireNow I feel like, the ashes glowCars passing on the freewayMy mind is on the runI keep running from my shadowI'm not the only oneSomewhere in the distanceSomeone's taking flightDestination unknownJust fade into the lightThere's so much said and doneBut after allThe time has come, to leave it allBehindIf you could see it through my eyesYou's know I tried to change it allI've been trying all my lifeTo stand up every time I fallIf you could see it through my eyesI feel sadness up my spineThe future on my handsI'm standing here aloneWith open arms againTomorrow ain't no strangerThere'll be a lucky starAnd love will find it's wayInto someones heartToo late for tearsNo time to be confusedIt's just the echo of ourSwan songIf you could see it through my eyesYou's know I tried to change it allI've been trying all my lifeTo stand up every time I fallIf you could see it through my eyesYou'd see that love will always waitSomewhere out there is my lifeA new love that comes my wayIf you could see it through my eyesThrough my eyesWhat was meant to be foreverIs breaking all apartWhat was meant to be foreverLeaves the hole inside my heartWhat was meant to be foreverWe throw it all awayWhat was meant to be foreverWas nothing but a gameWhat was meant to be foreverIs breaking all apartWhat was meant to be forever
They're days that make you flyThey're days you want to crySometimes the walls come tumbling downThey're moments in the darkWhen pain just floods your heartAnd you surrender one more timeJust take a walk out in the rainWith every drop that fallsYou know the sun will shine againThey're days you're naturally highThey're days you want to dieSometimes your world goes down in flamesThey're moments deep in loveBut when it breaks your heartYou just surrender one more timeJust take a walk out in the rainWith every step you makeYou learn that life means constant changeTomorrow's all that countsAs life goes round 'n roundYou gotta draw the lineGoodbye yesterdayTomorrow's all that countsAs life goes round 'n roundAnd if you keep the faithTime will call your nameTake a walk out in the rainWith every breath you takeYou feel your soul is free againTomorrow's all that countsAs life goes round 'n roundYou gotta draw the lineGoodbye yesterdayTomorrow's all that countsAs life goes round 'n roundAnd if you keep the faithTime will call your nameTomorrow's all that countsAs life goes round 'n roundYou gotta draw the lineGoodbye yesterdayTomorrow's all that countsAs life goes round 'n roundAnd if you keep the faithTime will call your name

I saw the morning It was shattered by a gun Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried I saw a mother She was praying for her son Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die  Do you ever ask yourself Is there a Heaven in the sky Why can't we get it right  Cause we all live under the same sun We all walk under the same moon Then why, why can't we live as one   I saw the evening  Fading shadows one by one We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice I saw the children The children of the sun How they wept, how they bled, how they died  Do you ever ask yourself Is there a Heaven in the sky Why can't we stop the fight  Cause we all live under the same sun We all walk under the same moon Then why, why can't we live as one   Sometimes I think I'm going mad We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care But in my heart it doesn't change We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love  And does it really matter   If there's a heaven up above We sure could use some love  Cause we all live under the same sun We all walk under the same moon Then why, why can't we live as one  Cause we all live under the same sky We all look up at the same stars Then why, tell me why can't we live as one

When love kills loveSuddenly I think I always knewI had my share of mistakesMade quite a fewFinally I know and that's for sureI don't look back in anger anymoreSuddenly the sun comes up againThere's a new beginningWhen we pass the endFinally I know and that's for sureI don't look back in anger anymoreWhen love kills loveWill someone rescue meWhen love kills loveIt's cutting through so deepSuddenly I wake up from the dreamSomeone tells meI've been talking in the sleepFinally I know and that's for sureI don't believe in daydreams anymoreWhen love kills loveWill someone rescue meWhen love kills loveIt's cutting through so deepWell life goes 'roundAnd upside downIt's pretty madWhen love kills loveWill someone set me freeWhen love kills loveIt's cutting through so deepHow can we chooseWhen all we loseIs all we haveWe run awayFrom all the painWe run awayFrom all the painWhen love kills loveWill someone rescue meWhen love kills loveIt's cutting through so deepWhen love kills loveWhen love kills loveWhen love kills loveWhen love kills love

Woman you can change my worldWoman you can change my world I'm chained to the fears Inside these wallsThe silence talks loud 'Bout the things I recallThrough the bricks in the windowI scream at the worldBut when no one is listeningIt's hard to be heard Woman you can change my worldWoman there'll be no return  I see shadows Coming through the wallsI hear voicesBut no one's talking at all I can feel the madnessCrawling up my spineReachin' out To grab your mind Woman come and change my world(Do you remember all those fears?)They won't leave me alone(Do you remember all those tears?)I pretend to be strong(Do you remember all the pain?)I'm getting tired of the gameI cannot live I cannot dieI want to know who the hell am I You've never seen meBut I know you so wellAnd before it kills meI gotta break the spellThe deeper we touchThe higher we'll goThe time has comeTo heal my soul Woman you can change my world (Do you remember all those fears?)They won't leave me alone(Do you remember all those tears?)I pretend to be strong(Do you remember all the pain?)I'm getting tired of the gameI cannot live I cannot dieI want to know who the hell am I Woman I'm gonna change your world
In the temple of godsThe day had come to come togetherIn the early morning sunThey saw that girl that come to heaven They ask her 'bout life on earthIf it was getting any betterShe told 'em someone took her lifeIf they could send her backJust one more timeShe knew that someone feels so blue Wouldn't it be nice, hold onTo spread the wings and fly, don't kill the butterflyTo see him one more time, hold onTo be a yellow butterfly, don't kill the butterfly He's been sitting on the bayLost inside a cloud of darknessWhen I saw the butterflyDancing in the windThe story goesHe knew that she was still so close Wouldn't it be nice, hold onTo spread the wings and fly, don't kill the butterflyTo see him one more time, hold onTo be a yellow butterfly, don't kill the butterfly
The yellow raven sipped the airOf thunder and of rainThe yellow raven sipped the airGentle lies kissing the rainWhere do you go, fantastic dream bird?Take me away to somewhereTake me away from here!Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?Answer to my yearningTake me away from here!The fire bird began to cryWhen the music died awayThe fire bird began to cryAnd smoke was slowly drifting byWhere do you go, fantastic dream bird?Take me away to somewhereTake me away from here!Where do you go, fantastic dream bird?Answer to my yearningTake me away from here
