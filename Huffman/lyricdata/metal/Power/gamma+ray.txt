The businessmen got a job to doThe Eastenworld is waiting too.They're sittin' on a bloodstone calling you a beggar,Waitin' for another deal in open cars.The presence of the men gives a bad vibration,They're countin' dollar bills, and they're workin' onThe final countdownCountdownI'm sitting all around and I'm waitin' for the lyricsthey gotta be cool, botta satisfy the critics."Sign of warning all across the edges"maybe too pathetic... and my pencil scratches,Meanwhile X is comin' from MiamiAnother perfect deal was made in open cars.I don't care 'cause I'm much too busy,I have to write my lyricsAnd I'm waiting for the final countdown,Countdown.It's jut a matter of timeWe're only waitin' for the end of the worldAnd we got nothing to loseWe're only servants of the monsters we curse.It's just a matter of timeWe can be sure we'll be doin' our worst.And we're waiting for the countdown.We're sittin' all around and we drink our lage,Thanks to God we got no embargo.What is left to do when you're looking for pleasure,Somehow we gottta lose the pressure.We're sittin' on a blood stone, worker, boss and beggar.I don't give a damnI want my open car.God has tourned to money, Jesus is a LiqueurI'd rather get my record done and party for the final,COUNTDOWN, COUNTDOWN.

Who will creep inside your mind a night,Who makes your wildest dream arise?Who makes you see what you can't see,While you're awake but in your dreams?Out of a world we call the twilight zone he comes,Out of a world where all your reason is a lie.DREAM HEALER - he makes you see what you can't seeDREAM HEALER - reflecting your identity.Shout at the morning when the red sunrise awakes,The call of reality is all you hear.Gaze at the stars, when the night comes down againThen you begin to see through all of your fears.Out of a world where you can see what is insideOut of a world where all your reason is a lie.I see red and I see blue,I see green and I see yellow - yellow lights.One day black another day white. He's one day quietAnother day he calls my mamaHe's comin' out - he's comin' outListen to dreams - they always tell you the truth.Listen to dreams - it is your heart that's speakin' to youListen - listen to the dream healer.

As the heat is rising, out there in the pastFallen angels calling, they have come to lastThey are coming out of the darkThen the horsemen ride out,everything grows coldNow their armies march in,out there from the underworldI do not want my eyes to see,I never wanted to believeTake me to the gardens of the sinner,Bury me and let me rest in peaceNow the time of truth has come for everyoneThe fallen angel stands in victoryThe final seal was broken,it opened up the gatesFor the dark avengers,their anger kills the light and then ...I do not want my eyes to see,I never wanted to believeTake me to the gardens of the sinner,Bury me and let me rest in peaceNow the time of truth has come for everyoneThe fallen angel stands in victoryAs the seventh angel opened up the sealHis curse brought endless deseaseAnd as the wind carried the deadly seedto the minds of the doomed,They were gone for the stage of hellTake me to the gardens of the sinner,Take me down and let me rest in peaceNow the time of truth has come for everyoneThe fallen angel laughs and grins, now...Take me to the gardens of the sinner,Bury me and let me rest in peaceCelebrate the time of truth for everyoneThe fallen angel stands in victory ...
The sun goes down in the western skyThe shadows are gonna return,I wander alone through the back of my mind,The twilight of moonstarts to burnHow I can see beyond existence?I'm leaving into the unknownI wander around as I hear someone scream,A voice that is never my ownOh, how can you dare to dwellAll alone in the back of your headAs we struggle for life in this emotionalWe wait for the gods to be thereGods of deliverance, how can I set freeSouls in the underworldCalling out for me...They're in my headWherever you'll roam in your dreams,You'll have to remember your nameSo many are trapped - down in the abyssThey're waiting for you and they sayHow can you dare to stand all aloneOn this side of the wall.As we struggle for life in this emotionalWe wait for salvation to call.Gods of deliverance, how can I set freeSouls in the underworldCalling out for me...They're in my headThey're in my head[SOLO: Dirk/both/Dirk]Morning comes around again,Shadows are leaving the nightNow there's a sense for existence,I've seen it with my own two eyesThe vision is now getting clearer,Now that I've seen the unknownThe voices I ycarning to live again,The gods will be guiding us homeAnd you still dare to dwell all aloneIn the back of your headStill we struggle for lifeIn this emotional hell,Salvation will one day be thereDon't you be misled,By the illusions in your headThen the gods of deliverance will say'No more illusions, we're leavin' todayDon't you be misled,By the illusions in your headThen the gods of deliverance will say'No more illusions, we're leavin' todayWe're in your head - They're in my headWe're in your head - In my head...
For no one to see for no one to hearThey fight for our souls without any fearWhen injustice done they open their gatesTo maintain balance between good and badAnd the winds of freedom blow they vanish into hazeThe mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hateThe guardians of MankindAre losin' their faith'Cause malice and falsenessSpread over the human raceThe guardians of mankindWon't shelter our soulsThe rulers of darknessWill soon gain controlDon't try to deceive them don't try to play false'Cause losing their favour will be the end of shelterAnd as the winds of freedom blow they vanish into hazeThe mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hateThe guardians of MankindAnd as the winds of freedom blow they vanish into hazeThe mighty shadow turns away and wisdom conquers hateThe guardians of MankindAre losin' their faith'Cause malice and falsenessSpread over the human raceIf guardians of mankindWon't shelter our soulsThe rulers of darknessWill soon gain control
Now... that all seems so quietAnd we all have survivedBut after allStill we fearThe hand of fate...tonightMen on the mountainFrom hell you came to destroyThe realm of our freedomEndangered to fade in the voidNow they are back on the earthTaking their wrath to our landAn ocean full of darkness awaitsWe will resist, fight until the endAnd down below the dark lord waitsTo fight our souls with hate,Our hearts with rage10000 dreams, for glory riseNow they're awaitingthe hand of fate tonightSo we have gathered hereBeyond the endless skiesAnd we are marching on and onForever moreFor the dark lord... he must fallOut on the edge of the worldThe wasted years are coming to an endThe oceans of evil shall fadeMaster of doom... we're taking it back againDeep in our hearts we hearThe call of the wildSpirits of yesterday will fly away10000 dreams, for glory riseNow they're awaitingthe hand of fate tonight10000 dreams, for glory riseNow they're awaitingthe hand of fate tonight10000 dreams, and still we rideNow we're awaitingthe hand of fate tonight

When I wake up at the end of the dayMoon comes out sun fades awayI get myself out of my bed and cryIs it really me now - could this be the real thingIs there someone else to ease the painSo easy, so easy now, has it really gone too farIt don't matter anyhow, sometimes I feel like anEcho in the wind, that's not coming back againI look inside my head and what I seeAre the reflections of the worldAnd I see genius and insanityYou're alive - you're part of the showYou came to foresee the signs on the wallSo many tried in vain - they know the truthLearn - how to live and fight and learn -How to fight them right and learn - how to give and take it allYou can be strong if you know who you areThe signs on the wall tell you move on before it's too lateCan you see them, do you want to be the one who's creeping on the floor?Could it be forever? Could it all be lies?The chaos is a killer and he knows who will fallHelp me - I need some helpNow is there someone out thereWhat are you waiting for?You're on the road to nowhereThe only way I knowMaybe I'm wrong, I haven't got a clueDon't know where I belong - tell me what is trueOh won't you come to heal me - heal me [repeat 4 times][Here comes the "undocumented piece"..they talk for a while something about well....God, afterlife, Truth - is all that real and such sort of thing]Think - don't think - what can you seeOur life is just a fantasy of someone we will never seeTherefore I break down in laughterNow as I change my point of viewThere's nothing left to make me blue - never again - no moreCome on in my friend and join the ballEverything is beautiful - even the band - it's magicImagine you're superstar you gonna flyYou gonna go far - far, so far[Solo Dirk]Oh won't you come to heal me - heal me [repeat 4 times]
I'm high over mountains I conquer the stormy seas I'll capture your fortress Bring you down on your knees I'm living the dream Break the chains of oppression from you In the Land of the Free I am calling for you I might come with thunder I might come with rain The choice's not given I will master your pain The edge of a dream See the glimpse of a new horizon Life is not what it seems Oh, can't you see Hear me calling on the wind Can't you feel the change begins Hearts of truth will freedom bring I'm calling on the wind Hear my prayer Where's the saviour Voice of anger will echo with force Watch the sunrise Taste of freedom Heart is bleeding I ride through the eye of the storm Hold on to your dreams Say farewell to the grand illusion Blinded eyes never see In the Land of the free Hear me calling on the wind Can't you feel the change begin Hearts of truth will freedom bring I'm calling on the ... Hear me calling on the wind Can't you feel the change begin Hearts of truth will freedom bring I'm calling on the wind On the wind On the wind
Too many people, too much trouble, too many problems in the morn.Another sunrise in the rubble, another ship sunk by the storm.Some little angel tries to tell me that it's over.It's just a bad reflection from above.The load upon my shoulder makes me stronger, even bolder.Oh no no, I haven't had enough.Heaven can wait, 'til another day.Cause there ain't no reason to leave.The world is a stage where we all can play.Another fine reason to live, and heaven can wait, heaven can wait.Each day a new reason to give up, each day another reason to sigh.A hundred thousand ways to live up, a hundred thousand ways to try.Hey, little angel, don't you tell me that it's over.You're just a bad reflection from above.The load upon my shoulder gives me reasons to get older.Heaven can wait, 'til another day.Cause there ain't no reason to leave.The world is a stage where we all can play.Another fine reason to live, and heaven can wait, heaven can wait.Heaven can wait, let it wait, let it wait, let it wait.Our eyes are close but they should be open wideLet's listen to the voice that's calling from inside.Let's stay alive and move on, on our wayHeaven - can wait'Til another day.
Where will I go now it's all overWhere will I be now all is said and doneHere comes the time, prepare for justiceSeems like my final journey has begunRiding on the wind, there's only one place left to goTake me to my afterlife, high up or down belowHeaven or Hell - where do we go when we are leavingHeaven or Hell - whatever comes to set us freeHeaven or Hell - I've gone a long way and I see there's no wishing wellThe choice is made, it's heaven or hellI'm not the one who was expectedSo I'll return and be from heaven sentI'm gonna get myself electedAnd now I want to be the president - "Viva el Presidente"Master of the damned I'll be the savior of you allTake me as a holy god to save you from the fallHeaven or Hell - where is my final destinationHeaven or Hell - whatever comes to set us freeHeaven or Hell - we've gone a long way and we'll see there is no wishing wellThe choice is made, it's heaven or hellMaster of the damned, I'll be the savior of you allI'm your revelation I'm a walking miracleHeaven or Hell - what is our final destinationHeaven or Hell - where do we go from hereHeaven or Hell - we've gone a long way and we see there is no wishing wellThe choice is made, it's heaven or hellHeaven or hellIt's heaven or hellThere's no wishing wellIt's heaven or hell
Inside the power cage, I can feel the music of my ageIt's paranoid first degree, it's telling me that I'm not freeI've got heavy metal music in my blood,And I'd like to get it to you if I could.As I lie here in the fright of darkness, the wings of light remove the veilIt's heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy metal mania all the way.Rock and roll was far too slow, and so the adrenaline just doesn't flowWhere is the power, where is the glory, heavy metal is my story.I've got heavy metal music in my blood,And I'd like to get it to you if I could.As I lie here in the fright of darkness, the wings of light remove the veilI've got heavy metal music in my blood,And I'd like to get it to you if I could.As I lie here in the fright of darkness, the wings of light remove the veil

Taken where the thunder rolls, into the blazing lightThe hand of fate is crushing down before meThe eyes of god have turned away, no angels are in sightAs I face the final chapter of our storyAnd now I hear the millions cry, screamingInto obvilion you take their livesHell is thy homeHell is thy home, darkness thy destinyWhere you belong, no need for sympathyThe antichrist is back againDisguised as the saviour of manServants of evil breed evilStorm fills the clouds, I'll wait for the fallSowing the end, grace comes to fallAnd now you're waiting for a sign, dreamingThe day is near when all the world is thineBecause hell is thy home, yeah!Hell is thy home, darkness thy destinyWhere you belong, no need for sympathyAgain you watch the millions die, no tears in your eyesAnd your followers will hall, the forces of evil won't failIn the great white hallA monster's working on the fall It's bloody war will kill us allHell is thy home, darkness thy destinyWhere you belong, no need for sympathyHell is thy home, darkness thy destinyWhere you belong, no need for sympathyHell is our home!
[Japanese bonus track] [Music by: Richter / Lyrics by: Richter] Save my soul from anguishDrained from fear to perishIn this world of tormentSave me, please save me from all We`re riding on a velvet dreamThrough ancient lands we`ve never seenFar across the hands of timeAre we lost forever? Rules and religions created to hateTo fear and incite, not to love and placateCompassion for murders, take God`s name in vainA fortress of evil is built up with pain [Chorus 1]I... I saw the signsEnlighten my mindTime after timeSilent tearsShadows of fearsSearch for the oneRevelation to come Silent tears in anguish and in fearsWe`re searching for the oneWhere we`re all coming from May your heart be strong and trueFor life`s a gift of love to youIn my visions I have seenThe world of mystery Leading me gently to open the doorI`m searching for answers, can`t stop anymoreBound by this passion, my faith is unfailedI`m holding the key to the kingdom of fate [Chorus 2]I follow the signsTime after timeEnlighten my mindRevelation take me homeWhere I belongHome to the one... yeah I hear you calling, calling for meSilent tears are fallingOn all that is real... nothing is real On wings of glory we shall ariseDestiny`s callingAll that is real... nothing is real Your eyes seem so coldSo wiseLost before they`re old It`s our creationWe build a symphony of fears(no more damnation)When you reach the ancient hallWill you trust me when you fall?To find salvation for your soul... Oh, is this the end?Or will I suspend?I will be strong, Revelation shall come [Chorus 3]I follow the signsTime after timeEnlighten my mindRevelation take me homeWhere I belongHome to the one... yeah Silent tears will wash awayAll that is real... nothing is realDo I surrender or is this the end?
We can win, we can lose We can swallow the bad news In the end we all know Our life is just a show Everybody plays a game and in our hearts There's hidden our real face  Who is the man who says I'm never gonna cry It's a lie - It's a lie And who is the girl who says I'm never gonna sigh It's a lie - It's a lie On the road to nowhere in the falling rain I've come to makin' my mind up to get to the point And here I go again  Who is the man who says I'm never gonna cry It's a lie - It's a lie No I'm not the man who says I'm never gonna die But I'm alive, still alive - alive  We are not guilty - we never know the way it goes Just like Heroes - heroes - heroes An all day routine We can be deadly wounded, but we can stand the pain We might lose the battle but for our ideals We stand right up and start to fight again  We all know our enemies but only God knows Who will fall lean back and lick your wounds Fight them all for you You are not guilty you never know the way it goes Just like Heroes - heroes  Who is the man who says I'm never gonna cry It's a lie - It's a lie No I'm not the man who says I'm never gonna die But I'm alive, still alive  Heroes - heroes - heroes We are heroes - heroes
Come to plague me, rape and take meFreeze me up, freeze me up.Politician, inquisition freeze 'em up.Freeze 'em up, freeze 'em up.They're closing in, the iron round.They hold the share in hand.To strangulate your way to live,The norm always wins in the end.Hold your ground, or tomorrow it will be taken,Hold your ground, or tomorrow it will be taken.Tomorrow it will be taken.Law and order, wall and border,Freeze me up, freeze me up.Automatic, democratics, freeze 'em up.Freeze 'em up, freeze 'em up.No parole on your housewall,So nice and clean - our land.And though they crash the hammer downResistance lives on in the end.They sneak around, they spy your mindYour unborn child's a number on their way into the grey.Insanity, they steal your dreams.They promise everything but they betrayDay after day

From our lives' beginning onWe are pushed in little formsNo one asks us how we like to beIn school they teach you what to thinkBut everyone says different thingsBut they're all convinced that they're the ones to seeSo they keep talking and they never stopAnd at a certain point you give it upSo the only thing that's left to think is thisI want out, to live my life aloneI want out, leave me beI want out, to do things on my ownI want out, to live my life and to be freePeople tell me A and beThey tell me how I have to seeThings that I have seen already clearSo they push me then from side to sideThey're pushing me from black to whiteThey're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hearBut don't push me to the maximumShut your mouth and take it home'Cause I decide the way things gonna beI want out, to live my life aloneI want out, leave me beI want out, to do things on my ownI want out, to live my life and to be freeThere's a million ways to see the things in lifeA million ways to be the foolIn the end of it, none of us is rightSometimes we need to be aloneNo, no, no, leave me aloneI want out, to live my life aloneI want out, leave me beI want out, to do things on my ownI want out, to live my life and to be free
Therefore I'm laying down in laughter Mighty, the mightiest life hereafter The trip we started hasn't finished here And while we think there`s not a shade of fear  Black points jump in crossing lines Insanity and Genius Both two sides are what I find And I know they're mine  Sometime my womb bears an actor Your mind creating tragic factors You've got knowledge stolen from the sea You've got wisdom just stolen knowledge  Black points jump in crossing lines Both two sides are what I find Insanity`s not far behind the genius inside  Close before insanity and genius close beforeSolo Dirk And everyday a dreamer dies To see what`s on the other side And everyday more dreamers die my friend While black points jump in crossing lines again  Companions in approaching time Insanity and Genius Good old friends in common life Insanity and Genius Close before insanity and genius close before
I look out to the stormy seaI wish upon a starPulsating light to comfort meBut oh, it seems so far So as I stand I realizeI wish that I'll be thereAbout to give up all my lifeand vanish in thin air But I know, as I dreamall the world has passed me byand I know I should do betterfor you and me tonight I'm coming home, Yeah! There were stars in the eyes at the masqueradeand the King was lost in the grand illusionWell, the the day has come , they've lost the wayand the Joker laughs at the mass confusionThey stand and stare Now listen all you peopleThis is what I sayRaise my voice in angerI'm trying to get away....... from all Now listen, what you're doingis just not good at allthe silly games you're playingare raising up the wall Time goes by, the world we loveis gone.....forever Are we ever gonna change our wayWill we ever stop the furyIs it life or will we just decayWill we lose or stand in glory Insurrection-God electionHeavy changes make my dayStorm the spire, Hearts on fireStorm is coming on its way Insurrection,

Comin' out of misery,back to the old energy,takin' part in our daily show.Think of what has been before,made a move and slammed the door.Future will remain in the unknown.Face the face of the race, try to understand.Why are we here and what do we want,The answer is easy, let's spread it around.Loud and proud, we're gonna say it now,Live-Life-EasyMany things to think about,bring me up or bring me downA lot of things I hardly understand.What is good and what is fair,problems solved, but I don't careSometimes it's just getting out of hand.Face the face of the race, try to understand.I know that you know that we can be strongIf we pull together, we can get alongLet us fly away, let us praise the daysWhen the lust for the life is stronger than the fear.Though we shiver and shake and we sometimes need a break.It's the lust for life that never disappears.

I don't believe in fame, I believe in music.I don't believe in money, I believe in the power of love.I know I got a brain and I know how to use it.I don't want no one to stick his finger in my pie.You think you put your best foot forwardBut it is moved by someone else.In blind belief you follow every path that says:I lead you to a universe of fortune, fame and luck.Do you really want to be, rich and famous, rich and famous.Do you really want to be, rich and famous now.I don't believe in Rock 'n' Roll illusions.I don't believe that what they say must always be the truth.I don't believe in good guys against bad guys.I just might as well say I believe in Santa Claus.You think you put your best foot forwardBut it is moved by someone else.In blind belief you follow every path that says:I lead you to a universe of fortune, fame and luck.Do you really want to be, rich and famous, rich and famous.Do you really want to be, rich and famous now.Mr. Big shot what is your gameMr. Big shot what is your final aim.Now you wonder who is to blame.Mr. Big shot what is your final aim in life.Rich and famous, house with two hours, big jacuzzi, car with TV.Private airplane, furs and diamonds, seafood cocktails-Crap and bullshitDo you really want to be, rich and famous, rich and famous.Do you really want to be, rich and famous now.

Mankind has found every treasure on earthIt stands to reason that we have got all we need.Comfort is now a condition of life,Without any sources our dream will fade away.To live a better way was our final aimDid we ever try?Start runningThe moment of reason will somebody appear,But then it's too late to return to stay,No single person can change the truth,We have to move forward and do it side by side.To live a better day is our final aimAnd we won't stop tryinStart running, can't you see the hangmen are comin?The things we have done to destroy our world are enough.How long will the madness remain?We're children of the warriors, we learn from our faults,Hope is our guiding hand, conscience is our force.

Masters are relentless, torture is for slavesMoney, greed and power drives you to obeyTemperature is rising, shakes me to the coreBlood and domination, victims of the lawWhen bloody angels spread their wingsWe're drowning in madness, the heart of the Unicorn...Dwelling in sadness, the heart of the Unicorn......is deadI see the demons rising, beyond their sleeping voidDeep and down the masters take them to the lightTheir piercing rays are blazing, obliterating fastAll dreams are torn to pieces, vaporized at lastWhen bloody angels spread their wingsWe're drowning in madness, the heart of the Unicorn...Dwelling in sadness, the heart of the Unicorn......is deadI scan the dead horizon, illuminated curseIn squished imagination, catastrophies unfurlBeyond the cataclysm, a dream of UnicornsThe purest heart in heaven, stabbed by poisoned thornsBloody angels, searing with fire-turn to dustAll through the millenniums, I've seen the writing on the wallInto our oblivion, we are the riders on the stormWe're drowning in madness, the heart of the Unicorn...Dwelling in sadness, the heart of the Unicorn......is deadBeware - all deadNo light - all deadNo dreams - all deadNo life - you're dead

We follow our instance, we're livin' in between,The struggle of the races continues on the scene.A million miles above us the spirit is unseen,Beyond our small horizon it's got a perfect dream.We travel through the ages, we follow our dreamsBut the spirit of a free world is the final dream.The sun, the wind and water all we really need,We waste our time to satisfy our greed.We travel through the ages, the world remains obsceneBut the spirit of a free world is the final dream.We're about to lose control now, the prophecy is clear,Does it help to sigh and hope with sentimental fear?S.O.S.no more lifeboats here.If I could ask the maker about the master planCould he give an answer, would I understand?Our ignorance will drive us on, the world remains obsceneBut the spirit of a free world is the final dream.
In a land, far beyond the sunRules the darkness, faceless magicianBlack towers which raise into the skyCastle of tears, shadows passing byBlood is covering the mighty wallsOf those who lost their skin and bonesNo one ever saw the lightOh, slaves of the nightThere's a young man, chained on a stakeLifeless body, he has no strength to breakHis shirt is bloody, his head is hanging downHe's mean to die, the ruler took his crownThe wind howls through the emptinessA different sound as in the pastScreaming echoes in the lanesOh, victims of the painThe clouds passing by, a hole breaks the skyLight refract the dark and fills the placeWhite winged horse, such a powerful forceGallops through the sky to break the chainsThe winged horse lands by the oneIt snorts and stamps, the escape has just begunThe chains are broken, silence fills the placeHe backs the horse with his last ounce of strengthThe white horse rears and spreads its wingsTo reach the sky and search the kingsThe one will lead to win at lastOh, rulers of the pastThe clouds passing by, a hole breaks the skyLight refract the dark and fills the placeThe white winged horse like a powerful forceGallops through the sky to free the landThe white horse rears and spreadsThe kings return, armed with mighty swordsTo retake the land and banish evil thoughtsThey fight against the shadows, captured souls of the dark mightDethrone, the evil ruler to bring the sun to the night.The battle takes heavy tollBut they achieve what they're fighting forNow the land is free againOh, no more blood and painThe clouds passing by, a hole breaks the skyLight refract the dark and fills the placeWhite winged horse, such a powerful forceGallops through the sky to free the landBut still at night when darkness rules againWhispering shadows creeping through the lanesEvil creatures of the expelled magicianOh, it's a fight you'll never win

He had found a way to leave, to somewhere far from nowTraveling in his time machine a dream that had come trueFly my friend, you will see, something called realityI feel good, I'm alright, doing what I please - I travel timeFar beyond the rising sun I ride the winds of fatePrepared to go where my heart belongs - back to past againI just want to save the universe for all mankindHe wants to save the future of the EarthStep by step surroundings change as years go passing byHe only stops to gaze a little whileI push the button further on, I just can't get enoughI know I will return again but still I'm movin' onFar beyond the rising sun...As I'm movin' on I see things to come, I see tears and I hear laughterCuriosity, comin' over me, what is next and what will happenAnd I see the lies and I hear the cries and the marchin' of the peopleAs they go to war, Heaven knows what for - God I think I've had enough nowToo late, too late - I can't go back no more! I lost control of the engineNo light, no light - can't see where I have gone! Can't see where I have now gone toWhere am I now - stranded in timeSo many years have passed since I had gone and I have seen what's gonna beBut now I know it is useless to travel onAnd I will return to the time and place I belong toFar beyond the rising sun....

I'm watching the mountains I'm watching the seaObserving the creatures I am lost, set me freeAcross the heavens I made my wayI've seen empires rise and blown awayI have arrived at my destiny but after all there's just emptiness in meDot in the darkness, I am going madWhere are the others, there's silence in my headCause I'm watcher in the skyI've seen universes dieOut in the cold my systems overloadI am lost in timeWatcher in the skyI'm trapped in this nightmareEndless tortures and pain, millenniums have gone byUh, it drives me insaneWho am I now?I'm not man, I'm not machineI gave my life away for the Iron Savior dreamCause I'm watcher in the skyHooked to the circuits of a lifeless, cold machineLost in a world of artificial meansRipped out of my bodyI'll stand the rest of timeAm I perpetual? Am I divine?I'm a watcher in the skyMy soul has drowned in the tears I cannot cryI'm the watcher the chosen one but I am lost in timeI'm a watcher in the sky I've seen the years go byI am the chosen oneOut in the cold my systems overload and I am lost in timeWatcher in the skyWatching the mountains, watching the sea, watching the creaturesYou'll never be freeWatcher in the sky
So now we talk about destruction'bout the way that we might goI've seen the headlines in the papers,The truth is more thatn we should know.Somebody waek me from this nightmare,Is this a TV horror show?We can run and we can walkWe can sit and we can talk.But we won't stop the war - oh no!Silent whispers in the ice-machine todayCalling for my brain in silent ways,No more changes in this world in which we live inAnd I don't know who the guy isWho's talking with the friendly grin.I never heard of any bargainI don't know what's goin' onIt doesn't matter anywayWe won't stop the war - oh no!Somewhere - I might go insaneSomehow - I might lose my brainSomehow - I might even careAnd somehow - I never ever will accept the wayThat things are goingWe can rund and we can walkWe can sit and ewe can talk

Bodies lie around me, only shells left from the fightvictims of the ones that turn the day into the nightsurvivors stumble through the field,they're calling for the priestbranded with a sign, the number of the beastit's Hell! I can't escape the nightmare that's here before my eyesa prisoner of destiny, a victim of the nightmy thoughts, they move in circles, I'm heading for the fallthey tell me hope dies last, but I got no hope at all So talk to me, the world I seehas reached the point of no returnthe tons of grief killed my beliefmy heaven's on fire and it burns When the world's on my shouldersand the pain comes againthen I wish I could be therein my dreamland againThere I'm free from the madnesswithout chains and no wallWhen the world's on my shouldersI will pray for you all Is someone there to save us from the voices in the darkthe words fly out like bullets, they leave a deadly markthe mindless kill their agony with prices from the showthey're heading for tomorrow, but they don't know where to go So talk to me, the world I seehas reached the point of no returnthe tons of grief killed my beliefmy heaven's on fire and it burns When the world's on my shouldersand the pain comes againthen I wish I could be therein my dreamland againThere I'm free from the darkand I'm safe from the wallWhen the world's on my shouldersI will pray for you all So if you talk to me now about our beliefand all the meaning somehowis to make people freeAll our lives we fear, to be what we hatebreaking this curse with a firethat burns all the darkness away Save me, Hold me, Help meFree me, Love me, Heal me When the world's on my shouldersand the pain comes againthen I wish I could be therein my dreamland againThere I'm free from the darkand I'm safe from the wallWhen the world's on my shouldersI will pray for you all

Do you remember the daysWhen living was meant to be freeNot looking for fortune,not looking for fameThe beauty of life was the keyWe lived as one to conquer the worldA thousand dreams to come trueWe knew in the end we'll findThe meaning of life and the truthOnce proud and full of passionwe formed a better worldWe fought against oppressionand wisdom was our swordOn the path of glorywe searched the rainbows endLives meant to share,where's the sign that we'd sent?On sad wings of destinyWe're kings without a throneIf you believe in unityBelieve, 'cause you're not aloneSad wings of destinyThe haunting thoughts of painThe world's a patient majesty, but believeThe time, the time will take its tollNow it's the time for a changeThe days of your childhood are goneThe fool and the wise manwill burn at the stakeConfusion remaining too longViolence and hate I won't see anymoreThe innocent victims of fateThe prophets have writtentheir words on the wallWake up before it's too lateOn the path of glorywe searched the rainbows endLives meant to share,where's the sign that we'd sent?On sad wings of destinyWe're kings without a throneIf you believe in unityBelieve, 'cause you're not aloneSad wings of destinyThe haunting thoughts of painThe world's a patient majesty, but believeBelieve, if you won't change your mindAll will remain the sameAnd soon, we'll find a common endOn the path of glorywe'll search the rainbows endLives meant to share,where's the sign that we'd sent?On sad wings of destinyWe're kings without a throneIf you believe in unityBelieve, 'cause you're not aloneSweet child of innocenceAre you drowning in your tears?The time has come for you my friendDon't hide from evil made by your own handsLet us try to fly againOne day we'll rise againOn wings of hope to be free
