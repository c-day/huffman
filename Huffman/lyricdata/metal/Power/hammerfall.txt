They came at dawn into the morning lightBlack shadows riding on the mistPrepared for battle, swords were shining brightFilled with anger and harmCame to kill not to charmThe sound of metal screaming in the airThe time has come were justice rulesThe endless victims looking up in fearNow, who are the foolsOh, here they come, riders of the sunAnd they will fight Back to backThey're fighting hard, their way to victoryDead bodies lying on the groundThey are the soldiers of eternityAnd their swords spinning aroundOh, here they come, riders of the sunAnd they will fight Back to backKill with power, ready to ride, let's goThey got it all, they'll never fallBut they will fightThe night is falling, light will disappearA magic silence fills the placeCould read the warning, shining crystal clearNow they were lost for the chaseOh, here they come, riders of the sunAnd they will fightBack to backNo, no, no ,no

In the distance mace, I see two doorsOne leads to change, one leads to where I've been beforeI am an angel, on broken wingsI am the beast, the devil in all in betweenNothing at allIt's never dark here, it's never lightFeeling like I'm caught between two worldsBetween two worldsThe when night comes down, the blade comes outI wish, I wish, I wish I felt something at allNothing's wrong or right, nor black or whiteBehind the hurt I see the lust come shining throughWhat do I doJust like the rainbow, between mist and sunFeeling like I'm trapped between two worldsBetween two worldsNever laugh or smile, I never cryMy mind is numb, and I can't take it anymoreScreaming in frustration, no sound is heardAm I asleep, or am I starring in a dreamPlease wake me upSometimes the hunter, sometimes the preyFeeling like I'm trapped, lost and never foundFeeling like I'm caught in two worldsWithout a home

In a time of fear and confusion, silence charging the air The sunlight is gone, darkness lives on in the heart of the dragon's lair Lost in a world of illusions No trace of the missing ore Stealing our souls, we're out of control, knocking at death's door All our beliefs fading into ashes Heed the words that we pray For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn Now we charge, the battle is raging, blood runs everywhere Our anger is fierce, avenging the years No time for a final prayer Behold, the might of the hammer, elliptical bolts of fire There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide You're down to the wire Somewhere out there lies a new tomorrow for me and those who believe For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn OoohNow, I've returned from a place far beyond My mission I set, let it be done We still believe in a brighter future The dreams are ours to fulfill For a Hero's Return.

Is it too late to go in peace, I wonder how How these things did start anyway Maybe too late to find a way, when the Trail of grief is marked with memories Now when you're gone, the warmth Of the sun seems so faraway I believe, in everything I see, every Second is a miracle for me I believe, after sunshine comes the Rain, and when it's pouring down The only thing I feel is pain I walk alone through shapeless dreams My only home is the wasteland that I cross I close the door and turn the key Those days of joy are barely memories Now when you're gone, your star will Shine on, won't you shine for me I believe, in everything I see, every Second is a miracle for me I believe, after sunshine comes the Rain, and when it's pouring down The only thing I feel is pain
From our lives' beginning onWe are pushed in little formsNo one asks us how we like to beIn school they teach you what to thinkBut everyone says different thingsBut they're all convinced thatThey're the ones to seeSo they keep talking and they never stopAnd at a certain point you give it upSo the only thing that's left to think is this[Chorus:]I want out, to live my life aloneI want out, leave me beI want out, to do things on my ownI want out, to live my life and to be freePeople tell me A and B	They tell me how I have to seeThings that I have seen already clearSo they push me then from side to sideThey're pushing me from black to whiteThey're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hearBut don't push me to the maximumShut your mouth and take it home'Cause I decide the way things gonna be[Chorus]There's a million ways to see the things in lifeA million ways to be the foolIn the end of it, none of us is rightSometimes we need to be aloneNo no no, leave me alone[Chorus]

Words unspoken, sworn in secrecyA burning flame for the ones who believeThe prophecyRevelations from the sun as of the moonIn seven nights we became historyThe prophecyOn a cold dark nightWe set our sails to search for land so far awaySearching for the truthThere's a howl in the windOn this mystic trail of water we sail onThe source of youthAnd the storm breaks loose on the seven seasTag on the signs on the mounting sunNorthern light is shining on for usBreaking the ice in search for tomorrowSetting the sails into the futureLeave all your fears and your sorrowsFrom the mountain sideCame a twisted wind, it brought us new insightWhispering these wordsCome in the midst you'll seeSaid a voice, I thought it was the prophecyThe secrecy unheardAnd on the violent sea there's tranquilityWe saw the signs on the mountain sideNorthern light is shining on for usBreaking the ice in search for tomorrowSetting the sails into the futureLeave all your fears and your sorrowsA secret passage never to be foundIn front of us a delusion of sightThe prophecyFrom the mountains and the rivers down belowA silent breeze, there's a wail in the windThe prophecyWe've come from a land so far awayWe bow down to the words you prayStorming down the mountain sideNo place to go, no place to hideHere we stand under of cover the moonlightOh, the prophecy was bound to failHere we are, nowhere to be foundWe're trapped in another world and the journey's just begunAh, ah, ah

Do you remember how we used to sayEverything around us are made of clayWe were the kings and the others the fools,Playing by our rulesAdorned with golden shapes and silver dreamsYou count the seconds, every moment seemsLike your lost to the stars up aboveEven though you're fallingSpoken words made of trust, burning bridges between us,Turning diamonds into rustYou're running out of time, the higher that you climbThe deeper you will fall and lose sight of it allOut of time, on the lineLiving in victoryYou spread your words, I say devoid of truthWhat's left is fantasy of endless youthYou made a promise, a little white lieNow you're falling from the skyChasing dragons by the moon, burning bridges around you,Your deepest fears begin to loomYou're running out of time, the higher that you climbThe deeper you will fall and lose sight of it allOut of time, on the lineLiving in victoryIs it someone that hears you, is it somebody thereAll you know and all you will get, lie so deep down insideDreams of fortune in the dust, when all your bridges are burnt,Turning being into lustYou're running out of time, the higher that you climbThe deeper you will fall and lose sight of it allOut of time, on the lineLiving in sinOut of time, the higher that you climbThe deeper you will fall and lose sight of it allOut of time, on the lineLiving in victoryLiving in victory

It's been a long way but now we are nearThe midst of the fiery rainWe know the Thunder have summoned us allTo the place were innocence got slainBehold the omens, the rivers run redThe autumn winds carry the deadThe final warning, the very last commandShattered remains for the damnedWe won't surrenderNo never, we will carry onFrom the Lake of Fire they have comeFierce almighty legions, one by oneWhen the Flames of Glory touch the skyTrailblazers do or dieWe are the mighty, who soar through the air,Creating our own destinyWarriors once and Warriors to beForever our spirits fly freeWe rode on lightning we shone like the sunIn a thunderous symphonyWe fought them hard we fought them so brave,Sending them back to their graveThe Hammer has fallenThe fire still burns in our heartsFrom the Lake of Fire they have comeFierce almighty legions, one by oneWhen the Flames of Glory touch the skyTrailblazers do or dieThe visions we gazed upon,As the nightmare returnedOn the uncaring slopesThe mark of the shadows still burns
Undying nightfall, a king with no crownDethroned, imprisoned in chainsDuel the black horse, the Swordsmen must kneelCondemned to serve within the shadowsPut 'em next to their KingOut of the fire and into the nightA handful of brave men appearedCrimson thunder running through their veinsA bond that will last foreverNothing's stronger thanBrothers in arms are fighting tonightThe Forces of steel meet againBorn in the fire, they look to the skyPower of metal unchainedTime has come, break out of these chainsFight! proud for your kingdomBehind the defenders the king marches onBy divine interventionThey are fighting with Brothers in arms are fighting tonightThe Forces of Steel live againBorn in the fire, they look to the skyThe power of metal unchainedPast many nights they fought onAnd by the moonlight the battle was wonBut still the black horse is runningKnowing were the power will leadBrothers in arms are fighting tonightThe Forces of Steel live againBorn in the fire, they look to the skyThe power of metal unchained
They search the desert plainsIn the land of no returnTo seek out the danger, time to burnThey are the righteous onesThey've come to claim this landLike warriors under commandThey fight for gold and gloryProclaim the dead man's landInto the dungeons they must goTo find the answers, left untoldUnder the burning sunIn danger, eye to eyeThey all now that someone must dieInto the well they're fallingPast immortalityLed by temptation and devotionRendered deathless by the touch of the swordOnwards victory, let us hear your battle cryThe enemies, will renounce or dieHail the Warriors Of FaithTogether they march through the fireForever they're lost in this worldOnwards victory, let us hear your battle cryThe enemies, will renounce or dieEternally, they will fall under the signOf victory, fighting all for oneHail the the Warriors Of Faith
