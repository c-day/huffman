Seasons of madness fill my mindA lunar poet trying to findA conception of what life is all aboutSeconds pass me by I greet the minutesA the hours roll them overAnd years will drown the days and monthsWe are one, we are strangers in the nightSearching for our way to the lightLike an echo of unseen fantasiesThat you'll never be able to catchA drop in the ocean we're sailing uponThe angels of heaven are singing this songJust souls in the corner of our universeIt seems that it's all we areA drop in the oceanPlanet caravans sail on and onIn cosmic harmony they goWithin embrace of universal wombIs it cosmic madness, harmony?I ask you in my agonyAs time won't heal my wounds it makes me numbWe are one, we are strangers in the nightSearching for our way to the lightLike an echo of unseen fantasiesThat you'll never be able to catchA drop in the ocean we're sailing uponThe angels of heaven are singing this songJust souls in the corner of our universeIt seems that it's all we areA drop in the ocean we're sailing uponThe angels of heaven are singing this songJust souls in the corner of our universeIt seems that it's all we areA drop in the ocean
I don't know what to do I don't know who you are I'm calling from the silence We have gone too farI try to understand you, your life has been so cruel Please try to see it my way I've got something to sayAll those years were not in vain Even though there was much pain I try to learn from my mistakes I want to make it up to youA million light years away from youI amA million light years away from youI hope that you'd respect my honesty and faith and maybe you'd forgive me If I could make you see I want to say I'm sorry For what I did to you I'll get on with my life I hope you do that tooAll the years
I'm out on the open seaThe wind is embracing meI'm watching the setting sunFar far away from youThere's not much that I couldDo you know what's the only way for meInto the depths I fallInto the unknown darkness I goDown, Down, DownDown, down, downFalling into the AbyssA morning of no recallNo memory no nothing at allThe sun is blinding my eyesThe pain I feel in my headI think I go back to bedOr should I have just one moreInto the depths I fallInto the unknown darkness I goDown, Down, DownDown, down, downFalling into the Abyss
I feel like I'm drowningTrying to catch my breathDon't know what is happeningThere's no sense of timeDeep underneath my skinFeeling the pain withinHear my cryI feel drawn towards youCan't resistI don't know whyMy life is changingI cannot recallWhere I've been beforeThe abyss of your eyesMeaning so much moreAm I losing my mindThe sun isn't shiningBut your eyes light my wayI've found what I've been searching forMy love won't go astrayDeep underneath my skinFeeling the pain withinHear my cryI feel drawn towards youCan't resistI don't know whyMy life is changingI cannot recallWhere I've been beforeThe abyss of your eyesMeaning so much moreAm I lostSo many years my drifting heart has wandered aroundDon't turn on me, won't you stay by my sideWhere I've been beforeThe abyss of your eyesMeaning so much moreAm I losing my mind

I am the earth and skyI am the low and highI am the snowflake in the winter eveningI am the birth and deathI am your final breathI am the one that gave you life and freedomChoosing your own way[Chorus]Everything you've ever knownEvery seed that you have sownCame from me, I made youMy creation is supremeThis is all my perfect dreamNo mistakes in God's great "perfect" cosmic playI am the Alpha, I am the OmegaI am the beginning and the end of timeI am the Alpha, I am the OmegaMy whole creation stands before me tonightI am the dark and lightI am the day and nightI am the mirageI am the echoI am the fear and angerI am a familiar strangerI am the shadow, I am a star that guides youUntil the end of time[Chorus]I am the Alpha, I am the OmegaI am the beginning and the end of timeI am the Alpha, I am the OmegaMy whole creation stands before me tonight
The setting sun creates another world The shadows fall another day is in the end The Paradise is sleeping peacefully And one more day is again historyTell me can we go on like this? Everybody is living in a bliss Are these the last times of our Mother Earth? Or is it just beginning of new birth?Don't be afraid we must be wise Patient and peaceful and strong Maybe it's like you would throw the dice Then hope that nothing goes wrong Remember that you have the right to say All things that you feel inside Open your mind and you open your eyes Together now is the timeSing the anthem of the world But will we ever learn To control our hate and to forgive We must learn to find the way To just live another dayAnd be free like an Eagle in the skyHow about if God just let us down? If he just is polishing his crown? What's the key to the Universe? Is life down here just one big endless curse?Don't be afraidSing the anthem of the world

I'm staring at the wallSick and tired of allManic depression makes me crawlIt makes me smallI need some peace of mindThe prssure makes me blindThe labyrinth of pain, The exit I must findIt's all inside of me, The answers lie withinAnd all that I can win I take for myselfI'm the one who holds the keyTo all that I can beMy spirit yearns for truth,It's learning to be freeThrough the yearsI was doing things the wrong wayBut now I've changed It is time to sayAwaken the giantDon't let it sleepAwaken the giantLook deep withinI won't give up the fightUntil I see the lightI won't give inTo the gloominess of lifeThe end is in my sightIn the middle of darkest nightI see my future's brightI'm reaching for new heights
A new day is rising in ancient BabylonRevealing mysteries to seeAnd the endless caravanNever ending it's journeyWith the wings of the wind I will flyI can hear you calling meI am blind but I see BabylonYour memory haunts me foreverWon't leave me beBabylonYour glory's stronger than everFor all to see Centuries have passed byBut your memory still lives onIn the minds of those who seeUnder the summer moonThere comes a sightThat stays with me foreverI can hear you calling meI am blind but I see Babylon your memory haunts me foreverWon't leave me beBabylonYour glory's stronger that everFor all to see And underneath the starlit skyI feel so strong I'll never dieI'm on this road to EternityMy soul will live forever, I'm free
Another winterday is goneI'm lying here all aloneThere are many things like me here behind these closed doorsSomehow I lost the wayFear just led me astrayDeep into the labyrinth of my warped mindI lost all of my beliefAnd I felt my spirit breakThrough the rain, storm came over meBack to madnessI go back to sadnessI go back to madnessThere is no returnMust go back to madnessMust go back to sadnessI go back to madnessWill I ever learn?What I don't recall I will repeatHave you ever been hurt?Have you ever been abandoned?Have you ever been truly scared?Have you ever felt you don't belong here?Have you ever felt like you don't have a home?Have you ever felt you don't have a chance?From the moment of birth we are already dyingDeath is the only true salvationThrough death man is rebornLike a butterfly is born out of a caterpillarAnd after that, man is finally free
Before the summer turns to winterBefore the dreams will turn to snowI see the yellow leaves are fallingAnd soon I know I have to goBut I'll be back before the summerNext year you're in my arms againThe winter breeze will send my messageIt will keep you warm until thenThe path to home is long and windingI'll keep the flame alive for you until I am backYou and I will walk that road togetherI'll show that all the dreams are trueIf you only let them be before the winterBefore the summer turns to winterBefore the dreams will turn to snowI see the yellow leaves are fallingAnd soon I know I have to goThe path to home is long and windingI'll keep the flame alive for you until I am backYou and I will walk that road togetherI'll show that all the dreams are trueIf you only let them be before the winter

Here in the Universe I find some things that are so hard to understand The vastness of space just takes my breath away I see through history The years they come and go The seconds that will shape my destiny The time that we spend here is precious, that I see so clearWhat is our place in here? What is the meaning of the pain we feel? Where did all this come from? The galaxies, the moon the stars, oh I don't know I really want to know what is the meaning of evolution They say that we are the crown of all creationSo let's break free from these chains Of fear, hate and greed And join together singing our Celestial dream freedom is awaiting For those who take the path less traveled And in the end we'll all sing our celestial dream
I have been sailing across the oceansFlying across the blue skyWithout never finding the answerThe answer to the question whyJust when you think you reach it, it's goneChasing shadows, chasing shadowsChasing shadows, all your lifeHarder you try to fix things in your lifeFaster you know it's in vainSearching for loving from strangest placesNothing is left but the painChasing shadows, chasing shadowsChasing shadows, all your life
Summer's gone a while agoThe daylight dims awayI'm watching here how the snow begins to fallYesterday's like a dreamA memory in my headLike the life's gone behind the winter wallI'm lighting up the candles and lock the doorSitting by the fireIt's time to dream some moreI have to find a way how to surviveI am surrounded by the starlightI have to find the pathand to escape from the Cold Winter NightsAnd in the morning there's no trace of the sunJust gray fog hanging above my headAll the birds are quiet hiding in the woodsCan't see no movement are they all dead?
I wake up in the morningSo far away from homeTrying to make it through the dayMany miles are between usI'm sending my loveFrom this payphoneThrough the storms we've wanderedMany mountains we have climbedBut all the bad times are behindThe road is free, I'm coming homeWithout you I am likeA ship without its sailsCalling the wind to save meI'd climb the highest mountainI'd cross the seven seasJust to see you smile againAll the trust that was built along the yearsIs coming back to stayI know, just look aheadThe road is free, I'm coming homeWith every stem I'm closer to homeWhen I'm back you won't be aloneSoon I'll see the familiar door before my eyesAnd youThrough the storms we've wanderedMany mountains we have climbedAll the bad times are behindThe road is, the road is free, and I'm coming home
Living on the edge of falling downLike each day would be your last oneReaching for the stars that shine so farTake my hand it will be alrightFor you and me to goLook into my eyes they are black as night nowYou can see your reflections I tell you no liesYou are the prisoner of your own feelings it's trueThere's something inside you but you just won'tLet it come outWhen the night comes you won't be alone'Cause I will be there I will be thereWhen the darkness enters into your roomDon't be afrain 'cause I'll be thereWhen the darkness enters into your roomThey will put you down with their minds of steelDespise and scorn you just because they cannot feelHell is eternity hell is your destinyI can see it in your eyes that you want to sayBut you can'tWhen the night comes...Listen to me hear you're playingA dangerous gameThere is no time to waste anymoreBecause it is getting so lateGet what you got give what you canLeave all the mem'ries behindThey'll be haunting you forever
The times are changing so fast, I wonder how long it lasts. The clock is ticking time is running out. The hatred fills this Earth and for what is worth, we're in the end before we know. Throughout the years I have struggled to find the answer that I never knew. It strucked me like a million lightnings and here I am telling to you. Every second of day it is coming your way, future unknown is here to stay. Got to open your mind or you will be led to astray. There's a time to live, there's a time to die. But no one can't escape the Destiny. Look all the things we've done, under the burning sun. Is this the way to carry on? So take a look at yourself and tell me what do you see. A wolf in clothes of the lamb? Throughout the years I have struggled to find the answer that I never knew. It strucked me like a million lightnings and here I am telling to you. Every second of day it is coming your way, future unknown is here to stay. Got to open your mind or you will be led to astray. Let your spirit free, through window of your mind.Unchain your soul from hate, all you need is faith.I control my Life, I am the One.You control your Life but don't forget Your Destiny... It's time to say goodbye, I know it will make you cry. You make your destiny. I know you'll find the way. And outside the Sun is bright. The things will be allright. I will be back one day to you. So please wait for me

Now it is time for youTo close your eyesThey've seen much pain It's slowly filling your mindPretty as they areBut now so paleYou better leave all your worries farBehindNot long ago when youHad the FireBurning inside of you brighter than any flameYou were the one that I believed inKeeping our hopes up high where are you now?Where do you aim?Let me take you thereTo the place you knowWhy don't you Dream With MeThe answers will be foundNow it is time to open your eyes againSee how all the sorrows have disappearedFaded awayI am right here waiting for your callIf you still need me to guide your paceThrough the day[Chorus x3]Let me take you backTo the place you knowWhy don't you Dream With MeThe answers will be found
Looking back through time to my childhood daysI used to have a place where I could escape the realityBut lately things have been so difficult for meTrying to reach for the light in the fall of darknessWaiting watching my life I'm wasting my timeI'm losing grip from lifeGoing back to my dreamspace leaving it all behindSoon the things will be allright when I get thereAm I safe in here, nothing left to fearI will close my eyes and float away with streamWandering here in this eternal darknessNo signs of light anywhere I am going in saneNow I am leaving this lifeNo hope left I want to die
Lying alone in your bedImages from the past filling your headYou try to run, you try to hideBut there is no escape, your eyes are open wideLong time ago you felt aliveNow only emptiness is blackening your lifeThe time has come to break awayOr you go astrayDreamweaver, there is so much more to seeDreamweaver, there is a deeper way to feelDreamweaver, misery takes a hold of you paralyzes your soulDreamweaver, find a way to understandDreamweaver, you hold your fate in your own handDreamweaver - break your chains and make your moveOr you might just see a dreamweaver's fallThings that you startedAre still undoneWhile you are wasting you precious lifeThe sleepless nightsWon't leave you beYou're going astray
All through the night he is lying awakeWond'ring how much more can he takeWatching the walls where the shadows danceDrifting away into a tranceAnd his eyes are blazing with fireDreams burnt to ashes so many timesHighest of mountains, still he climbsReady to fly, cause he just can't stayFlame burning brighter with every dayAnd his eyes are blazing with fireLonging for the deepest desireHeart of an eagleHe flies through the rainbowInto a new world and finds the sunSpreading his wingsAbove all the sorrowsThe glory of EagleheartFever is burning in his veinsDetermined with courage, breaking the chainsBack against the wall under blood red skiesPrepared to fight until he diesAnd his eyes are blazing with fireLonging for the deepest desireHeart of an eagleHe flies through the rainbowInto a new world and finds the sunSpreading his wingsAbove all the sorrowsThe glory of EagleheartHeart of an eagleHe flies through the rainbowInto a new world and finds the sunSpreading his wingsAbove all the sorrowsThe glory of Eagleheart

When clouds are covering the skyI can't help thinking what's behindIn a fading eveningI feel strange thoughts in my mindWhat if we aren't alone hereThere's a clone of everyone somewhereThat duplicates all that we doNot like me not like you but our other egoThere ain't no wars or crisesOnly joy and compromisesTime has stood still Why don't you take me thereWant to feel some infinityWhy don't we just dareCoz after all remains, eternity A landscape with no treesAnd a mist arising from the distanceAn illusion just for meOr a proper reward and a chanceThere ain't no wars or crisesOnly joy and compromisesTime has stood still Why don't you take me thereWant to feel some infinityWhy don't we just dareCoz after all remains, eternity
Everywhere I go I see people staring at meIt makes me feel so strangeWhy won't they just leave me beSo take a look in the mirrorAnd maybe you'll see all the things that happenedWhile you were looking at meAm I really so differentIn the Eyes of the worldYou are no different to meIn the Eyes of the worldIs it so hard to see nowEverything we do is running to the sandAnd who is to take the food awayFrom the children's handWe all could be friends nowAnd it's not a crimeBut we have to be quick nowBecause we don't have much timeAre we really so differentIn the Eyes of the worldYou are no different to meIn the Eyes of the worldIs it so hard to see now
I'm sitting by the calm lakeAnd watch the setting sunMy feet are in the waterThe journey's just begunIn the mist there is a boat and it's heading towards meOn the deck the lady's holding her hand and I agreeI'm falling into fantasyThe dream goes onWe are traveling in the nightfallUntil we stop somewhereDescending into waterOn dark and hazy stairsNow she's leading me to the golden palace that lays aheadShe tells me I'm the one in her dreams and on her bedI'm falling into fantasyThe dream goes onI'm falling into fantasyDrifting alone
Come to me my disciplesSaid the stranger who cameHealed the sick fed the poorSpread the joy and the cureHe will rule our landWith his leading handWe'll achieve our deliveranceIs it just an illusionOr the mass confusionIs it just the work of the False Messiah?Victims of mass confusionFools will follow this manHe leads us to destructionTending us to damnationHe will rule.

Walking down the path that leads me to my memoriesPacing all the way without a care in my strideWhere are the friends of my yesterdayHave they moved on with their livesCan we still laugh and joke about things like before There's no need to hide the past that I have left behindIt's a good resource somewhere for me to findWhy am I waiting for someone to reach outIt should be all up to themKeeping in touch ain't that easy but I'll have to try Where have all the years goneThat's what I am asking nowWhat have I learnt so farTell me Father Time Tell me now Now I understand I'll take from time what I needAnd I store it inside it's there for me to findI can't deny that the years will pass byBut it won't bother meCoz now I will set out to realize my dream Where have all the years goneThat's what I am asking nowWhat have I learnt so farTell me Father TimeTell me now
Fly the mountainsPictures on my backHopeless feelingsEverything is blackWhat am I fighting for?What am I living for?(There) is a path that I don't knowYou gotta fight!Fight for your life!Until you die!Fight for your rightsEndless searchingIn this cyberspaceAll is turningInto a disgraceWhat am I searching for?What am I running for?(There) is a path that I don't knowYou gotta fight!Fight for your life!Until you die!Fight for your rightsFight for your life!Until you die
No Christ, God nor religionGave me the answers I was looking forArrogant hypocritesSelling the key to heaven's doorI've got my own wayI don't care what you sayYou speak your truth and I speak mineFind your own voiceUnleash the power withinGo find your own truth and let (the) others beLet your own light guide your way through lifeFind your own wayMake your own paradiseFind your own voiceIt's your own choiceFind your own voiceUnleash the power withinGo find your own truth and let (the) others beLet your own light guide your way through lifeFind your own wayMake your own paradiseFind your own voiceIt's your own choiceFind your own voiceIt's your own choice

I stand alone in the darknessThe winter of my life came so fastMemories go back to childhoodTo days I still recall Oh how happy I was thenThere was no sorrow there was no painWalking through the green fieldsSunshine in my eyes I'm still there everywhereI'm the dust in the windI'm the star in the northern skyI never stayed anywhereI'm the wind in the treesWill you wait for me forever?

Higher I set my goals everyday I make my own rules that I will obey each moment As long as I live This is the life I was born to lead Unique chance for me to express myself And fulfill my dreamsI'm in control of this ship of mine And everything will be just fineLike the wind I'm free to go anywhere I got my song, it dances in the air Now I know what I'll do with my life Now you will hear my freedom callAll those bad times I've had in my life Change into blessings if I change the point of view I needed them to grow I've changed so much, I'm finally free To do what I want without any fear and quilt It's so amazingI'm in controlLike the wind
Feel the night, conceal your frightIt came from your rightLook what you found lying on the groundShiny ball you don't know anything at allLook through yourself there's a mystery full of youAlways condemn though you never understandWhy you resist never knew how to fightYou touch the lightIt's Fright NightIt's Fright NightIn the dark the shining sparkFollow this mystery ballBut don't look back there's force of evil so blackReady to take you awayLook trough...Look around is this the end you see?Wrapped inside the pain and miseryIs it true when you say that you never would give upMemories fill my mind I can see childhood againLook I've found my old toysThey bring memories in my headAnd now we are big boys and that feelingIs dead and it's goneGlimpse of the childhood appears to me so clearTales from Sherwood they fade away disappearWhere am I going I can't see a solutionI'm here alone in the heart of the darkest nightIt's Fright Night
Shining there in the skyLights our way across the landBlack clouds in front of your faceFading into the hazeIn this prison of mineMy soul lies in despairMy mind wanders through timeTell me what is my crimeWhat is behind velvet liesHeart as cold as the iceIn this prison of mineMy soul lies in despairWon't you set me freeNow I have to leave
Music and words by TolkkiShining there in the sky light our way across the landBlack clouds in front of you face fading into the hazeIn this prison of mine my soul lies in despairMy mind wanders through time tell me what is my crimeWhat is behind velvet lies heart as cold as the iceIn this prison of mine my soul lies in despairWon't you set me free now I have to leave
I saw it in a dreamThe day that changed our historyI still can hear the screamsSwear it was no mysteryIn the heat of the blastHouses fell down into the groundThis happened so fastMankind disappeared without soundNow the world lives in shadow of atomic fearCan we win the fight for peace or will we disappear?Future ShockI saw it on the screenThe day that changed our lives and historyThere goes our dreamNuked into the sky don't know whyIn the heat of the blastWatch the beauty of the mushroom castIt won't take longYou won't live till the end of this songNow the...
Hear my call don't waste your timeRemember what we're fighting forHear my voice take my handWe've got to win this warWe were meant to be freeNot to live in slaveryTo the other Galaxie we goGather all our strength before they knowSoon the time will come for all of usTo unite our souls and heartsSave the universe
The sun is setting on the pain the people freezing in the rain the Earth is rolling in her graveI beg the light up in the sky to make me whole, To tell me why I can't be bothered to be braveAnd I've been waiting, and hesitating, and then I see the curtain fall: The wonder of it allMy heart was blind, but now I see I know the power and the glory of the world I took a breath and now I'm free I feel the glory of the worldThe demons sometimes find a way there's nothing keeping them at bay But for the power of my mindThe road to paradise is long and halfway there, I'm heading wrong I'm leaving all the pain behindThe wonder of it all my heart was blind, But now I see I know the power and the glory of the world I took a breath and now I'm free I feel the glory of the world

A failed painter, born to change the worldBeaten up kid swore his revengeWhirlwind of chaos and destruction man has never seen before Blind masses led like a flock of lambsDeception, blinded by the lieAnother "saviour" of mankind showed the way Gargantuan monsterSpread terror, food for the guns Obsession turned to hateIt was their final fateProjecting, persecuting, murdering and conquering the world A diabolical plan was createdArmageddon and the apocalypseSix million people vanished in the airFor the cause of one man Gargantuan monsterSpread horror, food for the guns Zenith of powerZenith of power - He changed the course of historyThe final hourMadness reigns Zenith of powerZenith of power - Remains forever a mysteryThe final hourMadness reigns
I was sent outTo the worldFrom the missionI just returnedThe dust has not settled down yetI thought I could have some restBut I feel like I am possessedI shouldn't be complaining 'cause I am blessedMust have been the GypsyThe Gypsy in meAll the pressureOn my shoulderI can feelIt makes me olderI've given everything tonightIs it enough I still have to fightMy heart is beating so fastIf this breath would be my lastWould I die happy or would I regret my pastMust have been the GypsyThe Gypsy in meMust have been a mistakeBut I agreed
Since you were born pushed into cornerAnd left all aloneTold what to do, obey all the rulesBe just like everyone else those foolsDay at the schoolTeacher's a bullyYou're mobbed as a ruleNothing from TVYour folks are awayYou are trapped inside this house you must stay - homeNow it's time for you to move onLeave the shadows of your pastDon't let them haunt you foreverHold on to your dreamSomewhere there's a beam of hopeWhich is guiding your way through the darkThis is your chanceYour love your romanceHold on to your dream and never give upIn your life - Hold on to your Dream

I feel the wind in my hairAnd it's whispering, telling me thingsOf a storm that is gathering nearFull of power I'm spreading my wingsNow I'm leaving my worries behindFeel the freedom of body and mindI'm starting my journey, I'm drifting away with the wind, I goI am Hunting High and LowDiving from the sky aboveLooking for, more and more, once againI'm Hunting High and LowSometimes I may win, sometimes I'll loseIt's just a game that I playAfter the storm there's a calmThrough the clouds shines a ray of the sunI'm carried from all my harmThere is no one I can't outrunNow I'm leaving my worries behindFeel the freedom of body and mindI'm starting my journey, I'm drifting away with the wind, I go[Repeat: x2]I am Hunting High and LowDiving from the sky aboveLooking for, more and more, once againI'm Hunting High and LowSometimes I may win sometimes I loseIt's just a game that I play
Feel the night time growing nearerFrom amidst the darkness I will start my flightSee the stars are shining clearerTurn around before you're blinded by the lightI am made of burning flame, cast from coldest iceThere is nothing that can stop meNow I ride above the sky, it cannot hold me backI dive within the deepest darkest spaceSee I vanish in the light, you cannot find me thereNo one can ever catch the falling starFeel the heat is growing strongerEverything that's in my way will be destroyedSee my journey's growing longerFor eternity I'm doomed within the voidI am made of burning flame, cast from coldest iceThere is nothing that can stop meNow I ride above the sky, It cannot hold me backI dive within the deepest darkest spaceSee I vanish in the light, you cannot find me thereNo one can ever catch the falling starNow I ride above the sky, It cannot hold me backI dive within the deepest darkest spaceSee I vanish in the light, you cannot find me thereNo one can ever catch the falling star

I'm walking the streets and I hear what you sayAdvising me telling me how to playI know your name it's called Mr. MeanOne thing I've learned, you don't know beansHigh I flyI touch the skyFar above the frozen mindsYou can't kill my dreamsYou can't kill my spiritI was born to be freeI walk to my own songEvery day the power grows stronger in meI walk to my own songHead up proudI'm the master of my own destinyYou think you know what is better for meHolding me lectures of how I should beShrugging my shoulders I leave you behindAnyway I look at it...you are blind
Look around turn aroundYou just might fall to the groundSail away break awayDamage done nothing to sayAll my life I've felt like an outcastBut not anymore, a thing of the pastFeel the sun, got to runFeels like life has just begunAll is new, different viewSo many things that I will doI'm leaving behind the things I don't needAnd with confidence i'm planting the seedI'm still aliveI'm ready to feel the wind in my hairAnd I know there are so many things to shareI will write my story againMasterplan of a new kindI was lost but now I'm foundI'm still alive
Mother watch your children The iron fist of fear is ruling our lives It's not too late to change the course We can make this world a better place to be inHow much more do we want until we're satisfied? What happens when we have what we want? Acquiring more , still there's never enough We forget those who really are in needThe end is near, or so they saySelling peace with gunsInfinity - Where do we go from here?Infinity - Where do we go from here?Infinity - Where do we go?Infinity - Where do we go from here?Guns spitting (out the) message of peace everywhere Is it really that we don't care? See mercenaries of fear selling love Telling salvation comes from above Arrogance and fear walking hand in hand We must see that there's much more to life than thisMother see your children Make us understand and help us to find the way The answers lie inside They are locked inside to the vault of truth for us It's time to spread the word around Be yourself and do what you want to do with your life Remember, you get just what you give You reap all what you sow You are in charge of your own life Infinity...You make your own way As long as you are here Find your place in life Make your dreams come true There's so much more than this A million ways to live Unlock the door To the universe with love Free your soul
(music and words:Tolkki) Sometimes I just want to lie in your lapAnd dive into dep blueWhen the world's too much to bear To get away I dive into deep blueThe Ocean of your eyes I sink into the mystery tonightInto deep blue When reality hits hard , I have a placeTo go into deep blueWhen I'm not wanted and I'm downEverytime I go into deep blueThe river of my tearsAll my nightmares , my deepest fears Into deep blue The sun is shining and I feel so fineIlive my life , it's only mineI've left the past behind for good There's no more sorrow The future looks bright ahead And after all what's been saidI'm standing here on my two feet With my eyes open
In the middle of the jungleThere are ruins of temples built along agoStone by stoneThey were made by the MayasA tribe that is not so well-knownEach pictures on the wallRecorded historyThey were gazing at the skySeeing stars telling them the daysOn the yearMonuments marked timeBut altars meant death and fearWorshipping gods now gone long time agoThe population grew, new cities were foundWhat happened then?Was it a strange decease that wiped away almost everyone?Or it might have been starvation caused by drought andA scorching sunIt's a mysteryThe way they disappearedIt's now historyWe will never know
Time goes byBut you can't restToo many thingsAnd you're obsessedTrying to findSome sense to it allNo one knows what you've been throughLike no-one caresBut it's not trueTurn the pageAnd make a fresh startWhen you are lowYou should knowYou are not the only lonely soulAnd you will findThe strength insideThere is no more need to hideJust carry onFullfill your dreamsDon't let them try to pull you downSo carry onAnd reach your goal stand proudDon't give upMarch on till the endThe road is long but you'll reach the final bend

To see the things In a brand new lightNot to give up Without a fightTo surrender is not In my sightI'm a child of the UniverseIn the noisy confusion of lifeWhere uncertainty rules my wayIt's so easy to go astrayI got to keep strong and boldGive me a way to accept thingsI cannot change anymoreThe courage to change anymoreAnd the wisdom to know the differenceIn the midst of the darknessThere's a voice That you know so wellLifts you up from the madness Where you dwellDon't give in to the hopelessnessKeep the innocence in your heartAnd the end before your startBe the warrior of the lightDon't give up without a fight
Hey you, take a look aroudCan you feel the change begin?Soon it will be too lateIf you don't wake upOutside the winds are blowingAnd the people are staring so coldThe look that's in their eyesTells me something's wrongLead us into the lightIt's so strangeWe have gone too farStill knowing what will happenWhen we close our eyesIs this the hell on Earth?And the heaven is out of our sightOpen your eyes, realizeIt's not too lateLead us into the light
Life will go onSoon it is goneIt's bigger that we can conceiveWink of an eyeA thousand yearsInto eternity we shed our tearsI'm changing,Rearranging my destinyLearning to flyTouching sky on my wayLearning to flyHigh above the sorrowsTo a new day I flyNot where you standNor where you areIt matters only where you lookTo take the goodWith (all that's) badIt is the only way to goThe minutesThe hoursThe yearsRun fastLearning to flyTouching sky on my wayLearning to flyHigh above the sorrowsTo a new day I flyLearning to flyTouching sky on my wayLearning to flyHigh above the sorrows I flyLearning to flyTouching sky on my wayLearning to flyHigh above the sorrowsTo a new day I fly

Far in the core of the earthFirst it was given birthWe heard the call the message was so clearThe tracks were laid for the future to comeSons and daughters of the Rising SunThe armies in Europe here we comeWe run like the wind we play from the heartNow we are here together we singFaster than light, higher than the skyTonight we're together againWe never give up and never give inStronger than steel we're the Legions of the TwilightWe survived the hard timesNever accepted the liesYou run like the wind you sing from the heartNow that we're here together we'll singFaster than light, higher than the skyTonight we're together againWe never give up and never give inStronger than steel we're the Legions of the TwilightWhen we have to go back home againWe'll keep the memories we gained inside our heartsFaster than light, higher than the skyTonight we're together againWe never give up and never give inStronger than steel we're the Legions of the TwilightRaise your hands for us!
Sun is shiningSky is so blueI'm filled with hopeIt's promisingThe course my life is takingSearching of my truth has brought me hereFacing things with confidenceThat all will be okayPast is goneLife goes onMemories remainI break the chain of misery and painMarching to a different drumShines my libertyIt's growing stronger every dayI feel it in meLeading me to a different worldFreedom shows the wayIt's there for you and me to findIt's heaven on earthI'm standing here today and understandThere is no reason to hide anymoreSo many things to see so many things to gainMy life is not in vain
"Omnia sol temperat, purus et subtilis.Novo mundo reserat faciem Aprilis." From the dark I watch you go awayI will never see you again Every passing day prolongs my painI am slowly fading Into the void Voice without a soundA sound that no one cares to hearA second drownedYou live, your life just passed away Moment in a lifetimeLifetime in a moment Seize the day don't let it slip awayCherish every moment, before it's gone Voice without a sound, A sound that no one cares to hearA second drownedYou live, your life just passed away Moment in a lifetimeLifetime in a moment
[instrumental]
I'm going back through timeBefore the war this crimeWho would have believedThat they would do itOne April morningWithout a warningThe sirens woke us upTwo minutes to live we got I'm dying I'm cryingStill I'm the lordI'm fighting denyingStill I'm the lordOf the wasteland Now I'm alone hereThe last man on earth I'll beWalking through chaos landThere's just black mist and sand I'm dying I'm cryingStill I'm the lordI'm fighting denyingStill I'm the lordOf the wasteland
Luminous we shineLike the stars on the evening skyThrough the universeAnd centuriesThey are callingHear them callingLuminous moonshineIs guiding my travel through lifeI hear angels callingHear them callingNo tree has branches so foolishAs to fight among themselvesWe share the same biologyWe are oneWe are luminousLuminous when we dieWe return to the great oceanOf the living energyIt is callingHear it callingLuminous my lifeA breath in the cosmic playWithout reason or rhymeIts callingHear it calling
He's crawling out from the asylumUnder cover of the nightInsanity of his crazy mindIt's useless for you now to hideWalking the streets someone's in sightHe's waiting for you in the nightHiding in the shadowsHiding in the alleysHe's ready to kill tonightSo lock your doors and hideAnd pray your god 'cause you're not aloneYears he spent in the cageThey did not help him at allNow today with the power of his rageHe's slaughtering people tonightWalking the streets someone's in sightHe's waiting for you in the nightHiding in the shadowsHiding in the alleysHe's ready to kill tonightSo lock your doors and hideAnd pray your god 'cause you're not aloneMadness strikes at midnightMadness strikes at night
Let me take you to the far away placesWhere you've never been to the orient landsSoon you will notice the mountains and forestsWe're flying over them nowDon't you be afraid, just take my handas we race with four windsWelcome to the land of mysteryWelcome to the land of secretsThis is no ancient historyWe are flying through the gates of BabylonAllah is speaking us all with his mighty voiceBowing to his power as we go downThis magic carpet ride is not a dream to usIt's really happening
His year has been a nightmareI've been so low, I don't careI've dwelled in depths of darknessSwam across the ocean of painI've fed the tabloids, the mediaIt's a bottomless pit, a rediaFront pages, gossips, knifings, drunken nights and daysSadness, rage, hopelessnessI am nothing without youAgain the danceI do the maniac danceJust like in tranceI do the maniac danceThis demon serves me wellIt wants to send me to the depths of hellA roller coaster ride it has been I can tellI'm a walking miracle of medicineA real catastrophe on legsA proud member of human race known as the dregsXanax, Remeron, Therapy, BuspironAnger, Fear and ShameAgain the danceI do the maniac danceJust like in tranceI do the maniac dance

[Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Tolkki] More that I live More clear it's each day We got to change our ways There is no way to go back anymore Eons rumble through spaceWe must find new ways to live I know there's so much more to giveMillennium - Where do we go?Millennium - Time will showForevermore - The light will be guiding our journeyMillennium - Show us the wayMillennium - To the new dayForevermore - Give us a chance to changePeople may come and people may go But dance of time is eternal What is the meaning of this cosmic play? Will we see another day?We must find new ways...
Look at yourself but don't be afraidYou have much more than you seePreaching yourself, you're a foolAnd you fear the way of the world on your back There is no end to all this madnessThere is no hope for us at all Millennium - Where will we go?Oblivion - Time will show(...) - Following me through the [years] Millennium - There is a way[To stadium] - I show the way(...) - You should avoid at all cost Find your own way, forget all the badSee what the future will bringThere is no way to go back anymoreEons shoot out through the space There is no end to all this madnessThere is no hope for us at all Millennium - Where will we go?Oblivion - Time will show(...) - Following me through the [years] Millennium - There is a way[To stadium] - I show the way(...) - You should avoid at all cost
Time waits for no one So they say It goes on foreverThe tears of painI see in your eyesHow can we change for the better?Hate and greed's getting stronger day by dayInjustice rules the worldKilling the lungs of the EarthHow far are we prepared to go?I have seen the Light It came into my life There's no second chance We should have learned by now But it's not too late to change the course There's so much more than this, oh Mother GaiaCan you see, can you feel all the beauty that we have in this world? There's so much to see, forever Ignorance, arrogance Keep us from being ourselves so we just follow our leaders, why
I live on the street, it is my homeAll my life I've been aloneI see people passing byAnd they lower their eyesIt's been like this for so many yearsI had my share on lonely tearsMy parents left me long agoThey did not want to know[Chorus:]I'll be the rainI'll be aloneAlone in the rainYou left me hereTell me how can I stand the pain?Is there any hope for me at all?Hear me cry in the cold rainI never wanted to become A neon light childThere'll come a day when I'll be freeI will make people look at meI'll leave everything behindThere are good things for me to find[Chorus:]
Scream at nightsBut you won't be heardIt's deep insideThe pain within your headYou cry for helpThe torture won't let you goYour mind is achingAnd you can't go onReaching for windowYour executionThe only solutionNight screamerAfraid at nightsThere's nothing to be afraid ofYour nightmaresWon't leave you aloneTry and think hardWhat's wrong in your lifeTry and stay coolYou'll find peace of mindReaching for

Shades of nightI'm walking through sleeping villageThat is having a dream of thousand dreamsMoon is guiding my way through the landThe snow is silently fallingFrom the sky that is lit by million stars NightfallI feel the breezeNightfallOn my faceNightfallAnd the trees areNightfallCovered with white lace
So long I have been accepting what I've seen, never really speaking my mind. Now the heat's leaking out. I'd like to scream and shout. I want to leave it all behind. There's no one else to turn the wheel, I've got my own life to steer. No Turning Back, coz I want to know who I am and I want to live my life.No Turning Back, tomorrow's awaiting, I'm on the way. Hard to find the right words and not to make it worse. A choice that has to be done, it is just my life. Can't make no compromise and to stop what has begun. There's no one else to turn the wheel, I've got my own life to steer. No Turning Back, coz I want to know who I am and I want to live my life.No Turning Back, tomorrow's awaiting, I'm on the way. I have all the strings in my hands. The choices that's been laid for me. I am not taking more commands, coz now finally I'm free
Out to the light from the mistFrom the shadows I goFacing the new world the odd thingsThe places unknownFar away I sail away todaySeeing a new face impression the momentThe thoughtUnarmed and naked defenselessMy mind is caughtFar away it sails away to stayOut of the shadows we goThere's no reason to hide anymoreOut of the shadows we goInto the new horizonTowards the new shore we go
Flying to the dayOne day to playWith eyes open wideI am PapillonI watch the worldCuriouslyWorld is my homeI am PapillonI have no GodLife is in meI am in lifeI am PapillonBrightest of daysHolds me in embraceI am freeI am PapillonIn my dreamsIn my lifeIn my soulIn my eyesIn my heartI am realAh, I am PapillonIn my dreamsIn my lifeIn my soulIn my eyesIn my heartI am realAh, I am PapillonI watch the worldCuriouslyWorld is my homeI am Papillon

Late at night I find myself againWondering and watching TVI can't believe what is on the screenSomething that I wouldn't care to seeMany rare species will perish soonAnd we will be short on foodWhy do we have to be so selfishWe've got to change our attitudeI know that I am notThe only one that's worriedWhy don't we allWake up, and realizeLike the birds in the skyWe are flying so highWithout making any kind of sacrificeWe've got so little timeTo undo this crimeOr we'll lose our paradiseIt seems to me that there's no sense at allNobody cares it's always the sameMother nature's crying out in painWe are the ones to blameI know that I am notThe only one that's worriedWhy don't we allWake up, and realizeLike the birds in the skyWe are flying so highWithout making anykind of sacrificeWe've got so little timeTo undo this crimeOr we'll lose our paradise
I am facing the truth I got to change the way I live Can't go on this way The price is too high to payAfter the rain I feel the sun See how I run to my destiny Life is a game I got to learn how to play I make my own rules 'Cause now I am free to choose Courage and faith will show me the way Se how I run to my destinyLike the Phoenix I rise From the ashes of life I don't need fortune Or fame Just some peace of mindLike the Phoenix I fly leaving the lies behind Future's golden for me There is no one who can stop me nowI'm noble and strong I'm walking down the road that I choose Each day is a gift And I know that I can't loseGlorious future is waiting for me See how I run to my destinyLike the Phoenix...


What the hell is going onSki jumpers making music that sells goldThere's no talent in this gameHunting, hunting for the famePublicity is all you needThat's why it feels to me like[Chorus]Reign of TerrorEverything costs so much nowadaysAn individuals vanish in the hazeEntertainment for the massesSaving, saving your own assesRats are leaving sinking shipStill it feels to me like[Chorus]What the hell is going onEverything is upside downHunting, hunting for the fameTerror, terror everywhere
[Instrumental]
A house made of cards and no time to runUnfolding the path before meTogether with you and not making senseAnd slid from my grasp, that moment in timeWhen everything stood to reasonThe clarity gone, I wait for my fateBlack clouds gatheringWind, carry the word of my fateRide, ride like the windIt's fanning my flame, too bright to be realIt's burning my eyes to ashesI'm one with the steel, too bright to be realBlack clouds gatheringWind, carry the word of my fateRide, ride like the wind
Run the other wayWipe your tears awayThe pain is here to stayNothing in the wayTake the clouds awayThere's nothing more to sayThere's nothing more to sayRun awayI will remember youRun awayI will remember 'til I dieNever want to dieDrowning in the skyLike rats who left the trapWas it just a gameOnly doubts remainWe're drowning in the pain.
Season of change life feels so strangeLook into my eyes do you see the truthI'm lost and alone feelings unknownCome to me stronger than before On winds of time my soul will flyThe angels are knocking at my doorOh now I need to be freeFrom all this hatred I feel inside Let it be my dreamsLet it be my thoughtsAll those things in my heartOne too many daysOne too many yearsI wasted for nothing I never realizedThe truth is insideOf every man for all to seeListen to me nowI'm so close to youNever felt like this before The carousel is spinning fastBetter enjoy while it lastsEvery moment is like goldYou'll remember when you're oldAnd the meaning of this lifeIs to live and is to dieMake the best out of your dreamsThey're the world where you are freeAll the sorrow and the painWill be washed away by rainAn eternal joy will comeIt can be found by everyoneThough the end is drawing nearI'm not feeling any fearI have found the truth insideAfter all the tears I've cried Season of change
Seasons they come seasoned they goObserving them in their perfect flowChanging my life as they pass me byDrying my tears letting them dieIn the sunrise I am born againIn the sunset I die againWhat will you do when all fails?When you feel like a ship without sailsWhen desperation fills your mindAnd the pain makes you blindIn my silent truth I scream these wordsThe hope is loud!Never give up
I worked so hard to get my aimPulled out wrong card, is this my last gameToo fast too son you know it takes timeHasty deeds spoilt the chances of mineI'm burning inside, outside seems all rightTry not to think about it muchIt's hard to say when I will play againShattered, shattered, my hands are shattered, shatteredShattered, shattered, my life is shatteredI'm dressed to kill and ready to scoreThird pain pill and there's pain no moreI can't break out, out of these wallsWalls that sometimes the skull is calledI'm burning inside, outside seems all rightTry not to think about it muchIt's hard to say when I will play againShattered, shattered, my hands are shattered, shatteredShattered, shattered, inside I'm shattered
Welcome to my world, close the doorI don't wanna see nobody anymoreThe colors of my life are gone foreverFading like a dream away from you My world is all black, there is no lightLong time ago I knew the wrong from rightI still hear your footsteps in the hallFading like a dream away from me And still falls the rain Solitude is my only friendHow far can I take it?Solitude, you're my only friendHow long can I face it?
I'm waiting for the rain now, to settle the dusty air. Clearing up my emotions. Facing it all if I dare.I've been thinking, I've been trying but I've always been denying. Wasted days are still inside of me, it's time to set them free.Why don't we see what is going on? There are not so many years to be wasted until the damage is done and the beauty is gone.Save Our Souls.What is the price that we pay?Save Our Souls.Do we have nothing to say?
Pack on my back I wanderOver mountains across the seasMy yearning soul keeps roamingIn the endless search for peaceSky is my roof, my shelterStars shine and light my wayEarth is my bed, my altarOn this road that leads to nowhereIn silence I scream but no one listens to meAbsolution, salvation, my sins won't leave me beThe first cry, the last breathWe are born to dieThis madness never endingDon't know the reason whySoul of a vagabondIllusion, delusion, we are born to liveTemptation, damnation, starvation, deformationThe road goes on foreverIt's an old and trustworthy friendI have tasted its dust and treasuresBy my twisted mind won't mendMy burden is heavy to carryMy destiny lies aheadMy spirit is always leavingFor this road that leads to nowhereIn silence I scream but no one listens to meAbsolution, salvation, my sins won't leave me beThe first cry, the last breathWe are born to dieThis madness never endingDon't know the reason whySoul of a vagabondIllusion, delusion, we are born to liveTemptation, damnation, starvation, deformationIn silence I scream but no one listens to meAbsolution, salvation, my sins won't leave me beThe first cry, the last breathWe are born to dieThis madness never endingDon't know the reason whyIllusion, delusion, we are born to liveTemptation, damnation, starvation, deformationIn silence I scream but no one listens to me(Soul of a vagabond)Absolution, salvation, my sins won't leave me beThe first cry

Tears of ice falling down my cheeksForming a lake in it's surfaceI see you face and I watch it till it's goneThere were times all I did was cry out your nameOnly thing I feel now is painTears of ice frozen heart icy drop fall to the groundForming stream golden dreamThat will lead me to your doorThere were times all I did was cry out your nameOnly thing I feel now is painBaby you should see what you did to meNow I am crying tears of iceBaby you should feel like I felt in those daysNow I am crying tears of ice
I'm back in the air, but I've nowhere to goI nervously glance at the mountains belowTwo hours of sleep, seven more 'til the showI pray to the goddess of coffee to keep me aliveThe crew's getting wasted, we're back in the skyI join in the fray, 'coz the rules don't apply"Who cares anyway - when we're all gonna fry!"But somehow we manage to land and we all have survived...And the curtains are falling and the legions are calling tonightAnd the curtains are falling and the legions are calling tonightHave to fly away, though I'd rather stayThat's the price you pay, that's the game we playWhen roaring to life the engines are loudThe mem'ries of you and the sound of the crowdThey're fading away as we break through the cloudsBut I don't complain when we're back on the ground and alive...And the curtains are falling and the legions are calling tonightAnd the curtains are falling and the legions are calling tonight
The time is runningIt's running so fast that you don't noticeYears are passing byAnd you're growing olderWhat happened to all your dreams?Did they become true at all?We cannot undo the deeds of the yearsThey leave you on your ownWith all your deepest fearsDon't look for the futureDon't live in the pastJust take it day by day 'cause life goes fastThe minutes, the hoursThe days and the years will fly soLive still when you have the timeWe cannot undo the deeds of the yearsThey leave you on your ownWith all your deepest fearsWheel of the timeTurns again tonightEternally decides our destinyWheel of the timeTurns again tonightWithout reason or rhymeThe hands of time
Come with me my childIt's gonna take a little whileTo teach you the knowledgeOf the ancient rhymeFly with me tonightThrough the cosmic seaIt's a mysteryFrom the thirst for lifeYou will never keep awayPleasure of one manMakes another man a preyFly with me tonightThrough the cosmic seaIt's a mysteryThe hills have eyesMind your step you'll better be wiseOr you never rise againThe hills have eyesNever forgive nor compromiseYou fail in vain

The land of ice and snowWhere the midnight sun blowsHundred thousand lakes glowIn the land of ice and snowNorthern lights guide our wayCome whatever mayForest god protects our dayIn the land of ice and snowWhere Koskenkorva flowsWhere the freezing wind blowsSummer nights are white and warmIn the land of ice and snowSome night say that we are coldDon't believe all that's been toldOur hearts are made of goldIn the land of ice and snowWe didn't bow under oppressionWe fought and we diedRedeemed in bloodThe land of ice and snowHere I was born and here I've livedAnd one day here I will dieUnder northern starry skyIn the land of ice and snow
LORD OF THE WASTELAND(Music: Tolkki / Lyrics:Tolkki)I'm going back through time, before the war this crime. Who would have believed that they would do it.One April morning, without warning. The sirens woke us up to minutes to live we got.I'm dying, I'm crying still I'm the lordI'm fighting, Denying still I'm the Lord of the Wasteland.Now I'm alone in here, Last man on Earth I'll be. Walking through chaos land, there's just black mist and sand.I'm dying, I'm crying still I'm the lordI'm fighting, Denying still I'm the Lord of the Wasteland
I'm walking on a thin iceLying paralyzedThere's staying there's aloneReaching for the unknownIn the mirror I see despairIn the closet I smell deathThere's needles in my bedI've finally lost my head
TOMORROW(Music: Tolkki / Lyrics:Johnson)I'm staring out the window wondering will I soon know. The answer to the questions within where should I begin. I'm delusioned by a clear winter night, while trying to find some insight. The solution is close at hand yet still so far away.I'll turn tables 'round and find another way, I'll leave all this behind and move on today.I will take things as they come, look out for number one and I'll be back tomorrow.Feeling strong and brave inside.My head up high with pride, Yes I'll be back tomorrow.I'm facing my nightmares again determined that I won't bend. The answers are coming to me. I'm learning how to believe. I know now that this is the way. I've found my red-letter day. I've been there out on a limb but now I've finally come in.I'll turn tables 'round and find another way, I'll leave all this behind and move on today.I will take things as they come, look out for number one and I'll be back tomorrow.Feeling strong and brave inside.My head up high with pride, Yes I'll be back tomorrow.

Danger zoneI look into the mirror see my face againI hear myself preachingYou are getting boldGrowing oldSkin turns coldYou're to blameBut I will find the way to be myself againI break the mirror with a noiseStop preaching me teaching meLeave me beThere's no way to stop me nowMy end is in sightI reach for the lightTonightTwilight timeIt's twilight timeReaching for a morning lightTwilight time




What is wrong with a man destroying the land.Our planet is full of waste.Sheltering ozone layer is no more a shield,The temperature is rising up. Now it's time to stop this madness,Preventing increasing sadness. Let's put end to all this while we can. Man against another man, how somebody can, Judge by color of the skin.See the signs make up your mind,Now it's time for the change, it is not too late. Now it's time to stop this madness,Preventing increasing sadness.Let's put end to all this while we can. Save us, we are the future.Lead us into the better world,Show us the way to reality.No more injustice or cruelty. Save us, we are the future.Lead us into the better world, Show us the way to realityInjustice is all gone. Fast, fast stop this course now last,Last or we won't last, Past stop living in the past or you will die. End, end, end of our time,Time our precious time,Crime, crime against mankind we have to pay. In the course of mad destruction,There'll be no coming back,The nuclear end is in sight.Soon there will be no one to fight with.Take a look into the sky, it may be your last time.The complete end is in sight, soonThere will be no one to fight, with me. Save us, we are the future.Lead us into the better world,Show us the way to reality.No more injustice or cruelty. Save us, we are the future.Lead us into the better world, Show us the way to realityInjustice is all gone.

Sometimes it's not that easy finding all the wordsFor how I feel when you are nearThe more we are together makes me realizeAll I ever wanted is youWhat can I say?You make all my dreams come trueAnd every day I want you right here by my sideTo take my hand and hold me tightI never want to be alone againOh my loveThe days are shorter nowI'm reaching for some lightAnd I find it in your eyesBrighter than the sun it filled me up with loveDon't ever close them for meWhat can I say?You make all my dreams come trueAnd every day I want you right here by my sideTo take my hand and hold me tightI never want to be alone againOh my loveYes I know babyIt takes a world to keep what we haveAnd not let goI was lonelyBefore I met youBut you wiped away all the sorrowWhat can I say?You make all my dreams come trueAnd every day I want you right here by my sideTo take my hand and hold me tightI never want to be alone againWhat can I say?You make all my dreams come trueAnd every day I want you right here by my sideTo take my hand and hold me tightI never want to be alone againOh my love

When the stars are gone forever and planets are turned into dustIt's a good escape to lie in the hazeIn the past I found the answer in music and drinking and lustWaiting for the end and counting the daysBut I want to find an answer, so what if my terror diesAnd I want to find an answer, I look in your eyesWhy are we here?Maybe you hold the answerWhy are we here?Maybe you hold the answerWhen the sky is dark and winter has hidden the city in snowI remember summer's not far awayAnd it seems the days are shorter and hours are passing so slowIt's a nice escape to roll in the hayBut I want to find an answer, so what if my terror diesAnd I want to find an answer, I look in your eyesWhy are we here?Maybe you hold the answerWhy are we here?Maybe you hold the answer
I've been searching for an oasisIn the desert for so longIn my weakness tryingTo pretend I'm strongI've been holding onTo things that I have left behindI've been scared and lonelyI'm crippled insideBathed my soul in the starlightHealed my wounds in the sunScreamed my pain to the forestAsking the question why?Will there come a time for me when I find peace of mindWill I always have this feeling like I'm last in the lineI will climb up the mountain and light up the candle and ask:"Will my soul ever rest in peace?"I've been washed in painHaunted by the ghosts of years agoThey won't leave me beThey keep coming back for moreWill there come a time for me when I find peace of mindWill I always have this feeling like I'm last in the lineI will climb up the mountain and light up the candle and ask:"Will my soul ever rest in peace?"My crippled soul is yearning to be freeWill there come a time for me when I find peace of mindWill I always have this feeling like I'm last in the lineI will climb up the mountain and light up the candle and ask:"Will my soul ever rest in peace?"

Walking by the frozen lakeSilent snow in the airDreaming of the summer dayCaring me till I'm back Winter skies live me aloneWhen I lose my wayWinter skies, you call me homeWinter skies live me aloneWhen I lose my wayWinter skies, you call me home Bring me back when I am lostFar from your embraceBring me silence, bring me trustYour familiar face Winter skies live me aloneWhen I lose my wayNorthern star you call me homeWinter skies live me aloneWhen I lose my wayNorthern star you call me home Winter skies live me aloneWhen I lose my wayNorthern land, you are my homeWinter skies live me aloneWhen I lose my wayNorthern land, you are my home
The witch is worried Which is bitch?Take both of them in and do a spin experimentingWith fingers spreading lips concealing the secrets of the joyThe witch-hunt is coming to town you better look aroundThe witch-hunt is coming to town they'll see that you will get foundThe witch is cleverForgets never She take her revenge All in the endTwo at the time Bell tolls inside Casting joy all over youOh boyThe witch-hunt...The whip is ready Standing steadyIn between the hands By your commandDo what you have to do And she's glad toTake your little life And ride away
