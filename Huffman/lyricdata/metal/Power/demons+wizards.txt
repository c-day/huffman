The ocean's beautyNo longer moves my heartIt's black and emptyMy aim's so for a partI'm madness maddenedDriven by the waves of hateIt's him or me wellThat's in the hands of fateSomewhere deep withinThere is nothing left but troubleAnd the longing for the sweetness of revengeSomewhere deep withinLet revenge be mineCome all you mast-headsCome all you harpoonersSing out for him, wellMy order shall be clearAll you mast-headersYou've heard these words beforeIt's your blood moneyThis broad bright ounce of goldSomewhere deep withinI am forever AhabAnd this whole act is immutable decreedSomewhere deep withinLet revenge be mineA walk through the shadowsWe'll soon cross the lineThere is one thing for sureYou'll rise nevermoreA walk through the shadowsWe'll soon cross the lineBeneath these waves you'll sleepSomewhere deep withinThere is nothing left but troubleAnd the longing for the sweetness of revengeSomewhere deep withinVengeance shall be mineA walk through the shadowsWe'll soon cross the lineThere is one thing for sureYou'll rise nevermoreA walk through the shadowsWe'll soon cross the lineBeneath these waves you'll sleepBeneath these waves you'll sleep
And as I bear my inner soulI've kept it hidden and safeFulfill the god's desireTo hold their waning flameA sacred lifeAnd what have started long agoIs heading towards the endThere's no easy way outThere's blood on my handsBut I am sure in the endI will prove I was rightRunes of a long forgotten timeAncient spells in endless rhymesSoon the other world appearsRoam to the ghostly river RhineLeave the misty shades behindI can feel I'm getting nearBy the ancient spirits' ritesThe old ghosts proclaim their rightsStill they're lost in timeLost in timeI wonder why they're lost in timeLost in timeThe curse lives onStill chasing meIt's always been there by my sideAnd it won't let me outA treacherous leafAnd a secret unsealedIt will cause deadly woundsRoam to the ghostly realms at nightsTo cleanse the dark shades of my nightLeave the mortal world behindFloat to the endless streams of timeAn eternal ray of lightLeave my mortal shape behindLost in timeI wonder why they're lost in timeLost in timeThe blood on my hands you seeCannot be washed awayI am chosen by destinyTo dwell in misery

Ah, ah, We come from the land of the ice and snow, From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow. The hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands, To fight the horde, singing and crying: Valhalla, I am coming! On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore. Ah, ah, We come from the land of the ice and snow, From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow. How soft your fields so green, can whisper tales of gore, Of how we calmed the tides of war. We are your overlords. On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore. So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins, For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing

On and on this is my way I've made up my mind But will I find what I search for Soon I will reach the western shore Far behind in the distance Lie the fires of doom There's a voice deep inside me "The tower knows who you are" The road goes on and on Tomorrow I'll be gone The road goes on and on Tomorrow I'll be gone I hear him say "We'll seize the day" Too many roads we've travelled on We'll seize the day Now there's one thing left to lose We'll seize the day Until the end we'll carry on We'll seize the day Now there's one thing left to lose We'll seize the day All along this is my way I've better move on Pure in heart and fair-minded For strength and truth I keep on Keep the one that is passed on And leave the others behind All alone and without me I hear him say "We'll seize the day" Too many roads we've travelled on We'll seize the day Now there's one thing left to lose We'll seize the day Until the end we'll carry on We'll seize the day Now there's one thing left to lose We'll seize the day So stay with me we'll carry on See the winding road goes on

In a white room with black curtains near the stationsBlackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings,Silver horses run down moonbeams in your dark eyes.Dawnlight smiles on your leaving, my contentment.I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines.Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.You said no strings could secure you at the stations.Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.I walked into such a sad time at the station.As I walked out felt my own need just beginning.I'll wait in the queue when the trains come backI'll wait for you where the shadows run from themselvesAt the party she was kindness in the hard crowdConsolation from the old wound now forgottenYellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyesShe's jst dressing goodbye windows, tired starlingsI'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd,Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
