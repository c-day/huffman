On the fall of our kingdom time would never be the sameCursed mortals,their ignoranceBrought about undying painNot of life nor of deathLight, we'll never see againEntombed, now and forever by the suns blinding lightTrapped by flesh turned to stone, set free by the nightLavish lords that we once were condemned to never dieAs we watch the genocide from on highLong ago, the first age of earthFrom the dragons womb we're given birthProtectors of our fathers rightGuardians of primordial lightHow can we save our dying worldFrom the humans lack of sightThe darkest corner of your mindIs where we choose to liveReminding you of what you've lostIn your quest for dominanceOf our children all is gone except the terror in your soulOur image cast in stone, which once was flesh and boneThe time will come when we rise and reclaim our domainFrom the war and deceit which infests our worldWe are all around youWatching, waiting, in the shadows

The sympathy in my mind is growing coldLife is like the burning sand so I'm toldThe time is coming near when solitude appearsTake the chains of oppression awayThrough the sands of time I'm marching onThe blistering rays of hate strengthen meThe violent mass has shown my destinyDoes all of this justify the rage inside[Chorus]The desert rain is changing meIt's called on me to riseA world of hate and maliceYes, that's the way it seemsThe hour glass is running outThe serpent rides with meWe shall rise and conquerCrushing all that's weakAll that's light is burning outThe serpent rides with me[Chorus]
Mine is pure darknessIt is as blackness isDamn the light which comes fromYou as a moth to flame I burnIn the twilight of morning I rest my weary eyesFor the benefits of the nights bounty were manyMy soul has been redeemed (with those of others)I missed my love tonightHiding behind the figure I cannot bare to faceThat of a dead profitAnd his beast of burdenThorns ripping through his browSkin soft and white, eyes fire and iceJust as I recallNot longer than nine scoreCertainly food for the godsAnd fit for a princeHer throat I'll have it nowI will have her, she is mineRise of the sun, my test of timeAnd when shadows fall on unholy groundIt's time to sleep againAs consciousness slips into blacknessI rise to nights warm embraceAnd though my blood runs coldI know my love will be aloneAnd my mortal heart shall beat againLike it did ten thousand years agoForbidden love can only taste this sweetNot like the others so incompleteThe symbolic arrow that pierces my heartTakes the shape of a wooden stareNow I am the one crucifiedFor her immortal heart I'd give my ownAnd die for mankind's sinsBut that is not the nature of this beastI am deniedI will have her, she is mineRise of the sun, my test of timeWhen shadows fall on unholy groundI will make her mine

Emptiness, consuming meHead in hands, I can hardly speakLooking for solitudeLost in humanityTrue knowledge leads to sufferingA constant quest an endless dreamSearching for inner peaceHidden so deep in meDon't want to be a hollow manAin't gonna be the hollow manSadness comes knocking constantlyFilling up my eyes, for all to seePeace will come somedayI pray that it finds a wayDarkness caressing my mind and soulMy spirits rejecting, I'm feeling wholeEmptiness goes awayFills with the light of dayDon't want to be a hollow manAin't gonna be the hollow manI rise up like the pheonixFrom the ashes of an older wayWith wisdom gained, I turn awayI turned awayHollow man find yourself some other PlanDon't want to be a hollow manAin't gonna be the hollow man

I am your inner fearYour kind refuse to hearI am the lightI am the wayBut the fallacies of manAre easy to embraceAnd I, in purest formI always weather every stormAnd though you fail to seeThe truth is the pathThat leads to me[Chorus]Mankind's dishonestyLays them to wasteI am the truth,And I walk aloneHuman hypocrisyExacting their fateI am the truth,And I walk aloneThe flaws in your designAre breeding fearInside your mindAnd lies lead to disgraceA failure to reformThe failed human race[Chorus]
What do I seeOn the icy plainsThe desolate oneIt's my terrainThe wind it blows coldHowling my nameI am the kingThe king of this wasteCan't you see this barren landLain to wasteRavaged, scorched, yet frozenFrom your neglectI am the formless oneI came to saveYou are the chosen onesYou'll be my slavesI stand on the glacierAbove it allWatching them crumbleWatching them crawlIced Earth has risenNature will fallCan you feel the madness hereDrawing you all too nearEarth, fire, water and airSave yourselves from despairWe are together nowCrush the cowards, do it nowEnd the light, end the oneWe have come to saveThe young onesSo on an onThe story goesDestroying yourselvesThe pain it shows

Time is the bond of mortal lifeIsis with the scroll of lifeRaised her love Osiris from the deadLive can transcend the mortal coilWith this script, the high priest ofThe Pharaoh commits his sacrilegeDeath is but a thresholdTo another life, you will arriveWith this powerYou shall live again, there is no endYou'll live again...Love was the curse upon my soulFor it I would risk salvationAnd utilize the scroll to save this oneTime is the sentence for my sinThree thousand years my angry soul'sBeen trapped inside this tomb of my condemn.Death is but a thresholdTo another life, I will arriveWith this powerI shall live again, there is no end.I'll live againDawn shines a light on pain untoldScarred from the millenniaThe heart that beats inside my chest is coldRise, I'm rising from these sands of timeBy the scarab's power I am given strengthWith hate in hand, this misery I drinkDeath is but a thresholdTo another life, I will arriveAnd with this powerI shall live again, there is no endThis pain won't end
[Lyrics-Gene Adam][Music-Jon Schaffer/Bill Owen] He's the creeper in the night He's the reaper with a knife He wears a mask to hide his face He's always ready for the chase Killing for the vengeance Of his mothers death He's got murder on his breath Run from the creeper Hide in the night His knife is plunging deeper He's got you wrapped up tight  Creeper in the night Reaper With a knife Creeper take your life Reaper With a killing bite  Down in the lake He's gaining his strength His vision is blurred His mind is obscured From behind a tree Or underneath your bed He's looking for you He'll cut off your head Behind his mask He lies in wait His mind is obsessed He's gone insane Only to know the look in his eyes The pain and the fear And the tast of spite  Creeper in the night Reaper With a knife Creeper take your life Reaper With a killing bite

Make the sadness go awayCome back another dayFor years I've tried to teachBut their eyes are emptyEmpty, too, I have becomeFor them I must dieA sad and troubled raceAn ungrateful troubled place I see the sadness in their eyesMelancholy in their criesDevoid of all the passionThe human spirit cannot dieLook at the pain around meThis is what I cry forLook at the pain around meThis is what I'll die for Make the sadness go awayCome back another dayThe things I've said and doneDon't matter to anyoneBut still, you push me to seeSomething I can never beWhy am I their shattered kingI don't mean anything I see the sadness in their eyesMelancholy in their criesDevoid of all the passionThe human spirit cannot dieLook at the pain around meThis is what I cry forLook at the pain around meThis is what I'll die for

My only comfort is in deathMy only solace, my dying breathFor release, I have prayedThrown past life, not afraidLife's a bitch, life's a whoreNothing less, nothing moreThere is nothing she would do for meI will end this suffering[Chorus]Existence of one manHatred with no endMy madness, my sadnessI am my own saviorThe voices are calling Out of this life, I'm fallingThere is one choice, that I seeIn raging flames, The Dark One awaitsExistence of one manHatred with no endMy madness, my sadnessI am my own savior
On the plains of the desertA murmured cry was heardFrom the echoes of a wind songSinging of a wordThe word of the land begottenIs very seldom taughtTo natives of the desertWhich tribes of old have soughtWay up in the sky the sun is burning brightAll the natives screaming, screaming to be freeThe teachings of a wasted life and a darker deathThe burning sun is turning black falling from the skyAs the moon fades awayAnd the sun turns blackThe darkest fall from the skyPrepared for their attackIn the dawning hourThe doom and destruction beginsInside the natives mindsIt seems it never endsAt once the sun turns backAnd the battle stopsEveryone's in grave dangerExcept for those of the deadFor the one who shall deceive usIs the one...On the day of the night things were always wellBut on the night of the light all night things fellThrown into the pit you hear the natives screamThe legend lives on in the Sun God's eye
The feeling that you get when we creep insideYou won't see us there, you won't feel our stareBut when we're next to you we do all we can doTo get the cold sweat out, watch you squirm aboutAnd as you try to move we grab and strangle youWith all of your deceit and our realityNightNightmaresIn the nightHell is coming down, your fate has turned aroundToo scared to make a soundNow you're frozen there in your human shellIt's a nightmare I am the god of fearNightNightmaresIn the night
Passed down through centuriesThe order lives and feeds upon themA global fraternityPhilanthropy, tactical deceptionIn plain sight throughout all timeContriving human declineInstilling those who leadSeizing opportunitiesRise of setian evocationAnd the order thrivesSo the day arrive of his birthRise of setian evocationAnd the order lives for the dayOf man's coming curseCreate divisive creedsEmbrace the fact man needs religionProphets, saviors and priestsAll convinced they have the answersThe truth is they'll never knowBehind faith they'll hide and hopeWe'll build them a martyr sonSacrificial lamb, the holy oneRise of setian evocationAnd the order thrivesSo the day arrive of his birthRise of setian evocationAnd the order lives for the dayOf man's coming curseThe object of their divideSo convinced their way is rightThe narrow view of all mankindIn the name of god they will divide

During the last rays of the sacred moonI walk the desolate terrain cold and all aloneThe rider came to me a black tornado, a violent massThe cloud of evil rose, now I'm marked for all timeTemptation befell meDarkness is calling for meThis is the path that I chooseThis is the path that I chooseForced power besieged in meShowing visions of what will beNow obsessed with my fateI must go forth and conquerThe chosen one to lead the packThis boiling hate has risenFrom the depths of my blackened heartThis madness is my destinyTemptation befell meDarkness is calling for meThis is the path that I chooseThis is the path that I choose
I can see clearly now, a painful vision indeedAn attack on hallowed ground, from high aboveAlien to us, the species known as manA serious threat, in the eyes of the ElderSo heed my warning, before our own existence falls near extinctOur culture is lost in ancient mystery, covered in the sands of timeA sacred few survive the massacre this nightIn secret they will meet a new societyTen thousand years from now, a child will be bornI've seen the vision, the writing on the wallHe'll walk the Earth, two thousand years or morePaving the way, for mankind's fallSo there is hope you see, but we must act with great speedAssemble the chosen, the ones to lead, and morph them in the likeness of manOppressed for centuries, await the prophecy The child will set us free, reclaim it rightfullyWe'll take their identity and live among them freeAll the while, plotting events that mold their historyWe'll build the perfect beast with the knowledge that they seekIf it takes ten thousand years, we never will retreatAssassins we will be, through human historyJesus Christ to Kennedy, the Domino DecreeDisciples of the Watch, prepare the coming curseIf it takes ten thousand years, we never will retreatAnd so, our world is doomed, we'll lay claim again some dayThere is hope, in the birth of one, so many centuries away

Darkness calls down to meSweat pours from my body like rainGrowing wiser with each touchA pawn in lucifers game, am I?It attacks me in the black abyssThe entity formless yet full of rageThe mark of the beast my bodyScarring me for eternal lifeChorus:I brought this all upon myselfSold my soul to change my lifeIt's up to me and no one elseThe beast in me can't control my lifeBridge:And so it's begun, the end of meThe seed was sewn now it's growing insideMy fate in control, not mineHe liedChorus
Hey listen don't you let them get your mindFill your brain with orders and that's not right.They're playing at a game that draws you closerTill you're living in a world that's ruled by fear.Always takin' baby out that's o.k.What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me.Told you one you're never gonna win the raceSame old no tomorrow kicked in the face.We are screaming, screaming for vengeanceThe world is a manacled place.Screaming, screaming for vengeanceThe world is defiled in disgrace.Tie a blindfold all around your headSpin you 'round in the torture before the dread.And then you're pushed and shoved into every cornerThen they lead you out into the final slaughter.As the sweat is runnin' down your neckAll your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up.Oh your heart is pumpin' gonna soon explodeGot to fight the horror of this mental load.So you wait it out and bide your timeRip off that straight jacket gotta break that line.Everyone who wins in the great escapeLeaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake.I don't talk about it but that's alrightTable's turned now there's a revenge in sight.If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can waitSend them screaming back through their hell's own gate
Screaming in agony,Cries fill the airEyes once full of hopeShedding tears of despairAll that they've ever known is deadFire reigns from above,Iron birds of dreadAll that they've ever loved is deadAll that they've ever dreamt is deadYet there's a glint of hope,If the chosen can surviveIn secret, the ten thousand hideEast in the mountains,The chosen bide their timeThe Clouding, our strike on mankindTemples are burning,Streets soaked with bloodHeed the prophecy,Destiny is doneAll that they've ever loved is deadAll that they've ever dreamt is deadYet there's a glint of hope,If the chosen can surviveIn secret, the ten thousand hideEast in the mountains,The chosen bide their timeThe Clouding, our strike on mankind

I feel, you'll see, the night cold and deadBut watch out, we walk proudTogether now until the endIn these times we walk that lineThese frozen timesWinter nightsBridgeLook up to the sky, see the moonlit nightThe winter night sends shivers up your spineBut it's deep inside your mind that's where you may findInner demons and your desireDon't give up, don't give upDon't give up, don't you ever give upIf you find you've crossed that lineThen it's time, a state of mindBelieve in what you seeOur sacrifice, realityIn these times you walk that linethese frozen timesWinter nights
Innocence tainted by pure lunacyCursed by the slash of a shape-shifting beastOh no, this can't beDemonic infection, a doomed changelingHis future concealed as he begs to be toldA kiss from the gypsy, he'll never grow oldOh no, this can't beDemonic infection, a doomed changelingEven a man who's pureAnd says his prayers by night(He won't hear your prayers)Man become a wolfWhen the wolf bane blooms,And the autumn moon is bright(There's a full moon tonight)Man may become a wolf.He who is bitten by a wolf and livesPossession soon follows, no use to resistOh no, this can't beCursed by the moonlight, a doomed changelingThe madness a turmoil that swells up insideTo truly find peace is to truly dieOh no, this can't beCursed by the moonlight, a doomed changelingNow comes the rampage, a killing spreeHunting his loved ones comes instinctivelyOh no, it's maddeningA shape-shifting demon of pure lunacyA shot from the darkness tears through its fleshA bullet of silver lays it to restOh no, it's maddeningAn innocent victim finds his peace.
One the night the darkness fellAcross the naked landA demon force was summoned upFrom the bowels of hellThe stench of death grew thick that nightWe knew it was the endWe run to find a place to hidThe land was raped and bareThe wind it blows a eerie coldA fog that never liftsTheir tears will flood the land tonightAnd the thunder's drowned by screamsAs I lay hereFreezing veins of iceWhat will be for meWhat will be the priceIs it what they sayIs it written on the wallsWhy can't we stopThis shattered worlds' fateWhy didn't we try at allArmageddon town life is goneWe knew it was the wayWritten down so long agoImplanted in our mindsOur fathers told us of this hellThey read it on the wallsIt's written on the wallsIt's written on the wallsThe frightened children know not whyAnd no one will explainWe've brought it all upon ourselvesAn ending to this worldForgiveness for your soul you prayBut it's written on the walls
