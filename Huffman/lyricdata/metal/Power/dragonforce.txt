[Chorus]One dream in all of us still shining,One star, the ever lasting light,So alone, so lost inside, to the ending paradise,United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.In the dark December morning light,Far strong to the burning winds, the fires of Hell will forsake me,Shattering the chains that ever bind us,Suffering their pain eternally.For strong, smash the silence, carry on like before,Fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away,Storm with hail fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,Lost in times and long forgotten, governing miles away.Tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by,Still alive we feel the pain tonight,Stars fall through blackened clouds, and dreams that miss rains,A twilight star in the thousand lights for me.[Chorus]And still we save a breath for the world,Life brings up for us all,United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.One dream in all of us still shining,One star, the ever lasting light[Chorus]And still we save a breath for the world,Life brings up for us all,United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight. [Repeat: x2]

Strangers they come with the rise of the sun,To escape from this madness forever,Rivers will dry, bringing holes in the sky,As the empire is fading away.Silently watch now, and the lost souls run wild,In a time long forgotten, forever,Hate brings us sadness and the dawn of the world,But this nightmare will still carry on.Through the day we'll find a way, we're lost beneath the stars,Faceless they follow, and we all stand as one,Long wasted tears, but the laugh forever shining,One stand one last command to end it all.[Bridge]Outside the world in a fallen land, turn away from my despair,We stand alone in a silent dream, lost within eternity,Rise again and try to understand.[Chorus]The light for the world will save us tonight,Redemption still so far away,Marching on inside of our loneliness,Still searching for all that remains.And time pass me by,The light not so far away,Will the sons of the night, now our blood runs into the ocean,Tomorrow we're gone, our souls rising up to the sun.[Chorus]It's just one wasted life, in one wasted land,Suffering so far, and so alive,It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,Until the end of time,Inside the winter storm.[Bridge][Chorus]It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,Suffering so far, and so alive,It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,Until the end of time,Inside the winter storm.Inside the winter storm!

Life is a misery, don't know how it's come to beDeath, the epitome of all of our daysIn the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voiceClose your eyes and visualise the demon to ariseYou know that sanity is not as it was meant to beAnd now that misery has taken a new standIn the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rainIn the sun we will move along with the memories of the slainWhen I see this humanity and the evil that they have come to beWe've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...One more time to escape from all this madnessOne more time to be set free from all this sadnessAnd one last time to be the one who understandMy soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternityForeign the currency, your payment in blood to beDeath is the desitny for all of our waysIn the dark you hide away for who or what you can't sayWhen I see the power of the demon come aliveYou know that sanity is not as it was meant to beAnd now that misery has taken a new standOn the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sunReaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be wonCan you see the debautury and the blade of death that has come for theeIn winds of torment forever more you will cry for just...One more time to escape from all this madness...

Once again I'm here alone, my secret life awaits me,Still a thousand miles away from a land of broken dreams,Night falls and the stream is shining, forced the section behind the lines,Hours breached in endless we go, time and time again.Try to understand, desperately locked in a dream in my hand,Will you wait alone for me tonight,Hold me, save me[Chorus]A star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,One day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive,Cry for the day to return like no one can understand,We all face our fears in the world,We all hold our place in the universe,For eternityHide the lines, deceive myself, erase the past from my space,Images of loneliness sent far across the land,Once sure, but my eyes are blinded,Frantic charge for a place to hide,Lost generations apart, ancient life returns.Kindness in her eyes, taken away by a man in disguise,Won't you wait along again tonight,Save me, take me[Chorus]A star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,One day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive,Cry for the day to return like no one can understand,We all face our fears in the world,We all hold our place in the universe,For eternityTry to understand, desperately lost in a dream in my hand,Will you wait alone for me tonight,Hold me, save me[Chorus]A star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,One day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive,Cry for the day to return like no one can understand,Our past lives return to us allOur memories will fly free foreverSo far from the cries of the world, for eternity

Crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains highForest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonightOn towards our destiny we travel far and wideJourney through the darkness as your hearts refuse to dieIn the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has comeWith the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sunFar across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the swordWhen the time has come for battle now we follow with the hordeWe will ride with fire burning hot towards the night skyIn the land of long ago forever in our soulsFly on wings of shining steel are burning so brightIn ancient lands of warriors we're riding on againBurning fires burning lives on the long distant roadsTrough the lost mountains endless so far away from homeWarrior soldiers forever we fought long agoWe're all lost in the darkness so far away from homeFallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawningSun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of iceAs you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despairAnd they die in their sleep for the world that will not careYou feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismayThere's a voice inside that's calling another wasted dayCan't you see the history the suffocating madnessIn the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to goI have traveled far and wide across this wastelandStill searching for the answers for the right to understandBurning fires burning lives on the long distant roadsRiding through starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the skyA shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have diedOur only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding doneBlasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come
Outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall There's a chill in the air and the howl of the wolves and the rain beats at the door The seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountain's high And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry When the dawn of the a new sun will see the day and the strongest hearts grow old And the warrior stands on the top of the hill in the snow... Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up aheadIn the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one hears what once was saidAnd the eagles fly through the clouds and the earth bleeds dark and coldWhen the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfoldWhen the color of night will fade to light leaves the mysteries unfoldAnd the warrior stands on the top of the hill in the snow...And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall hoping for a better day And the we're never giving in until we find the words to sayBurning starfire, shine in the sky For the lives of great men who stands by your sideWhen the night falls on we will rise For no lost souls will live on forever Midnight on the valley below still the horsemen follow through There's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies And the shadows of night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone When the dusk of a full moon will see the night and the weaker hearts go cold And the warrior stands on the top of the hill in the snow... And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall hoping for a better day And the we're never giving in until we find the words to say Burning starfire, shine in the sky For the lives of great men who stands by your sideWhen the night falls on we will rise For no lost souls will live on forever And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall hoping for a better day And the we're never giving in until we find the words to say Burning starfire, shine in the sky For the lives of great men who stands by your sideWhen the night falls on we will rise For no lost souls will live on forever

Finally all the world will see. Rise again before the endless silence. Burn your soul before we'll all be free. Light the path beneath the blackened, burning sky!One final sacrifice, this night belongs to me. Turn back before the dawn of Winter. So far away the cries set fallen angels free. Through my mind tonight our journey ever after. Never ending solitude this is the life to be. So cold and dark the voice of sadness. Suffering in endless pain the truth of all to be, crawling back to life through ever blinding darkness.[Bridge]Free falling, fate's warning, find the life to hold on. Soul stealers, true believers, spies now they are gone! And as they ride away, forsake the ones who save us, Winter's dawning on a lost, fallen god. Pray now, united in a lifetime, hold on. Won't you wait for the silence so strong. Wait for the dawn.[Chorus]Tonight! Falling like the rain insanity lives on. Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying. Raging endlessly they come. Whoa! And the morning light will hide another day's gone by! And the sun will shine again across the blazing sky! Glorious, eternally, we'll rise above the world. Marching onto victory, we fight. The fire still burns!Looking back our past the lives, their memories to see. Flick through the passages of silence. Hidden by the sacrifice to set the demons free, now they understand, reclaim the land, relentless. Fear calling, transforming, stand alone in our time.[Bridge]Abdication, decimation, slay the vision divine! And all the stars fall around the world tonight. Silent forces from a past life return. Pray for the silence in a world so alone Till we touch the horizon beyond. Fly through the storm![Chorus]The tears in your eyes. A lifetime of misery. In silence we stand all alone for the fate of our own destiny. A lifetime of lies. One chance at this fantasy. The judgment will pass for the cries of the world that has faded for me.[Chorus]
Close your eyes, hear the thundering rainHere inside of the torture and painFor the cries of the world and the last lives remainHear your heart's way to die for the gameDeep inside slowly fading awayAnd the last breath's in vain and the fear turns to rageLocked in the world by the fallen evil soulsTorn right apart from the roughly seamBreaking my mind now to bring my life to warReach out and die with the flamesSee through the lives of the red hot stabbing eyesNow is the time to defend your crownDestiny will call to remind us allWe fly free so far from here there's one thing we'll relayAnd dreams of everlasting pain the fallen now rise againThrough the fire, through the flames like the sun we'll rise againLost in time, lost in space to the end of other daysSee their endless ways: insanityThe quest will rage, not meant to beIn flames of hell forevermore eternally[Chorus:]So free your heart leave your life far behindIn the cold dark winter skies escape the pain insideNow feel your soul lost in scenes of all eternityEvery day of this life, defendingAnd the flames of youth not endingIn a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal painSo alone in the world far away, memories of the dream will remainAs the world's falling cold and your life's all in vainFire in your soul will forever rise againNothing in your mind to remember nowHeld here by the fear of the dark land callingFly free on endless seas, the final curtain fallsOn the ground from down below, the time to lock and to loadThrough the fire, through the rain, far across the distant plainsFeel the wind beneath the steel as your mind becomes insaneSave the hate of all humanity, their eyes belong to destinyFor freedom now we rise alone again[Chorus:]So free your heart leave your life far behindIn the cold dark winter skies escape the pain insideAnd when the memories are all left behindAnd the days are gone forever, lost within my mindNow feel your soul burn in scenes of all eternityEvery day of this life, defendingAnd the flames of youth not endingIn a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal painWe fight through the eternal pain
Strangers to reason, our bleeding hearts so cold,Life brings a change it seems, fear will blind the soul,In the silence one only will know,Cast away can it fall on the wastelands.Send the soul from the forgotten sickness, and save his life,Challenge the dream before the long departing, your mind is right,Hear the burning thunder roar,Still lost in a fire storm,Tonight we feel the past return.Lost inside the dream, beside the life we'll live forever,Still the wasted time that burning we love,One thousand shattered voices, lost inside an endless wonder,Tonight her voice will take me home.[Chorus]Shine glorious we ride, we stare into the blackened sky,Save the last command, the virtue blinding,So far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside,Once alone again, silence stands for our last journey home.Our lives intensified, mutation, frustration,Ever lasting lifetime in beyond the world,We'll travel endlessly, they're moving, he's jointed,One man can understand his sad misery.They've taken my heart,They've taken my soul,And now we stand below in sanity.In time we'll see the past unwind,Alive, still wander in a fallen land,One more time we stare into the blackened sky,For tonight, in our hearts now we feel,One last time see our destiny reveal.[Chorus: x2]Silence stands for our last journey home.
So many fires bring mass devastation, many search exact inspirationJeopardize the right to hide from sad existenceNothing left, still searching for something deep beneath the criesWait for the deafening silence, fly forever moreCrush with a thump and you're all alone, evasion in your eyesI will be waiting tomorrowStriving to understand, wasting a life not meant to beTwisted and so broken once againAnd the promises we've cast away will shine a guiding lightVictim of your brief of denialTake my hand, this one last timeFace the world before us, the warrior insideIn a lifetime of disaster, it's a battle to the endFinal step, my life must carry on and forever this timeBattered, beaten, forced to submission, stricken by your fatal decisionSuddenly it's time to say your last goodbyesMisery remains voluntary, all the gold is goneWait through the blistering madness, free forever moreBlinded my eyes with your filtering, mutation cast asideI still be wanting tomorrowSlammed to a toxic man, forced to a life of yesterdayFears of our salvation crushed and burnedDown this lonely road we see the day our dreams are brushed asideCan't brigade this emptiness in timeTake my hand, this one last timeFace the world before us, the warrior insideIn a lifetime of disaster, it's a battle to the endFinal step, my life must carry on and forever this timeSee through the skies far beyond the world tonightHear the sounds of freedom ring in a silent dreamAnd a million miles awaySee through the skies far beyond the world tonightHear the sounds of freedom ring in a silent dreamAnd a million miles awayBefore the storm some people lost for a realm of freeIn our hearts for a thousand years and a thousand lifetimes beforeAnd the dawn of a new day will rise, add light for us all
On a cold winter of morning,In the time before the light.In flames of death's eternal reign,We ride towards the fight.When the darkness is falling downAnd the times are tough all right.The sound of evil laughter,Falls around the world tonight.Fightin' hard, fightin' on for the steel,Through the wastelands evermore.The skeletors souls will feel the hell,Bodies wasted on the shores.On the blackest wings in hell's domain,We watch the lands become.In fire and flame, and once again we know.So now we're flying we're free,We're free before the thunderstorm.On towards the wilderness,Our quest carries on.Far beyond the sun down, far beyond the moonlight.Deep inside our hearts and all our souls.[Chorus]So far away we wait for the day,For the light source so wasted and gone.We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,Through the fire and flames we carry on!As the red day is dawningAnd the lightning cracks the sky.They'll raise their handsTo the heavens aboveWho descend unto their lies.Running back through the mid morning light,There's a burning in my heart.We're banished from the time in the foreign land,To a light beyond the stars.In your blackest dreams see to the need, that destiny is tied.And endlessly we're roaming free tonight.And on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality.All alone in desperation, now the time has gone.Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind,Day after day this misery must go on.[Chorus](Whoa's)Now here we stand with their blood on our hands.We fought so hard, now can we understand.I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can,For freedom of every man.[Chorus]
Here we are, far beyond the distant skySeen all the world and how the story will be overThrough the snow and tainted mountains we have climbedNow we have found the light that guides us overThrough the falling rain we travelled far and wideAnd through the blackest darkness, stars above shining brightThrough the sun and winter rain will fallAll our lives we all were waiting for a sign to callWe're walking hand in hand in dreams of endless timeHow do we know when we will leave this life behind?Stare at life through eyes of mineThe hate, the fear and the painThere's a feeling held deep insideWhen life you live is in vainFly away down the lonely roads of yesterdayWe close our eyes to see the light of brigther daysAnd all alone we'll be where time can never healWith the trail of broken hearts flying freeOnce again we walk this lonley roadThere are times that we were wading through the rain and coldWe're lost in memories of what we left behindRelive the dreams, the endless screams of pain insideLives are filled with emptinessThe fear returns once againSearching endlessly, now we will seeDrown your mind in the painFly away down the lonely roads of yesterdayWe close our eyes to see the light of brigther daysAnd all alone we'll be where time can never healWith the trail of broken hearts flying freeThe last temptation will be all that's left for meWhen I see those tears you criedWhen I hear those lies you liedWhen I feel all creation now falling down on meIs this the reason to be?Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterdayWe close our eyes to see the light of brighter daysAnd all alone we'll be where time can never healWith the trail of broken hearts flying free
On a cold dark winter nightHidden by the stormy lightA battle rages for the rightFor what will becomeIn the valley of the damned A warrior with sword in hand Travels fast across the land For freedom he rise And the sign from the master on high He screams a loud and across hear the cry For the kingdom of fire and ice And the power to be alive Four strong ride on carry on through the war Four strong carry on living for ever more On the wings of death By the hands of doom By the darkest light From the darkest moon Crossing silent seas Over mountains high All will stand as one tonight On the black wind forever We ride on together Destroying your evil with freedom my guide When the master will call us He stands high before us Our hearts filled with splendour Our swords will shine over the lightIn the valley of the damned Days breaks with golden strand Over pastures green it glows To where night returns On the shadows faces appear Warriors wearing full metal gear Join together one and all Before the glorious lightRise up gather around come and hear what is said Use your senses open your mind don't you ever forget On the wings of life By the hands of hope By the brightest light From the brightest sunCrossing silent seasOver mountains high To the valley of the damned On the black wind forever We ride on together Destroying your evil with freedom my guide When the master will call us He stands high before us Our hearts filled with splendour Our swords will shine over the light On the black wind forever We ride on together Destroying your evil with freedom my guide When the master will call us He stands high before us Our hearts filled with splendour Our swords will shine over the light
Full the moon and midnight skyThrough the dark they rideWarriors of forever will sacrifice the rightOne for all and all for oneThe future time has comeFaces filled with tormentYour heart beats like a drumNever will you look back againYou'll fight on 'til the endTogether we will live onForever moreIn this land we have defended from all things dark and cruelNow we are defenseless in a land where dragons ruleIn this land we have defended from all things dark and cruelNow we are defenseless in a land where dragons ruleFlash of steel in the mid-day sunThe battle has begunBlood spills all around us but still we carry onNo mercy we will show to themThe white flag shall be raisedWe'll fight for our freedomRide towards this evil placeWe all stand until the end allegiance to this gameIn this land we've defended from all things dark and cruelNow we're defenseless in a land where dragons ruleIn this land we've defended from all things dark and cruelNow we're defenseless in a land where dragons ruleSun set in the western skyThe battle's almost doneThe victory will be gloriousOur enemies are gone
Outside of this world,There's a life force still burningOutside of this landThere's a star shining freeIn silence we stand,On a golden horizon, callingThis time there's a light for usStill shining so bright for usAgainTrapped inside this paradise still bleedingWhile there are so many faces in this mask of liesBlinded by the promises and the life in painNow the time has come for all of us to riseThrough the fires of hell between usThrough a lifetime of our dreamsEndless tears still burn insideBeneath the sadness of our screamsAnd the years of our forsaken landsSilent we stand here aloneNothing to say when the evil finally burnsWe all stand in silence for the wasted and goneOne warrior standing through a thousand year stormOur past lives still shining, the starlight revealsOur glory remembered for the power of the steelAnd the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallenLike the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgottenWe all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,For the last time we cry now for freedomCast aside, this dying world forsakes usBreak the chains of our creation now to save our livesBlight of all eternity and the curse of steelLike the winter rain will tear the blazing skiesFrom the wastelands of destructionWith the fire we hold insideRise again, still gloriousFor the power of all mankindThrough the years of our forsaken landsSilent we stand here aloneNothing to say when the evil finally burnsWe all stand in silence for the wasted and goneOne warrior standing, through a thousand years strongOur past lives still shining, the starlight revealsOur glory remembered, with the power of the steelAnd the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallenLike the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgottenWe all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,For the last time we cry now for freedomThrough the trials of fire behind us,In the dark and burning skiesFallen tears still lost insideWithin the memories of our livesAnd the years of our forsaken landsSilent we stand here aloneNothing to say when the evil finally burnsWe all stand in silence for the wasted and goneOne warrior standing, through a thousand years strongOur past lives still shining, the starlight revealsOur glory remembered, with the power of the steelAnd the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallenLike the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgottenWe all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,For the last time we cry now for freedomFor the last time we cry now for freedom again!!!
