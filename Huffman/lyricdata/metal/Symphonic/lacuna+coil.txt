Simple as I amThe lies aroundAre convincing me there's nothing right thereOutside only breezeCold that rescues meThe wound in hereIs reminding me that I'll be one dayJust a broken wheel onto your way I don't want to please you forever While the magic diceAre on the groundIt's so hard to decide between myself and youPain is covering me As a healing windThat clears the skyWill you promise me the things you told me?Will you give me everything I want? I don't want to please you forever No liesI'm purifiedAnd no more failure in my lifeWater onto my fire I don't want to please you forever

We're still struggling halfway through this journey.Our eyes are burning but we're not slowing down.I wish we could have all the time in the world,but we have come too far to give up who we are. We fear nothing, we fear nothing.Lifelong, road blocks, high walls, teardrops,nothing stands in our way.Bloodstain, star crash, mistakes, heartbreaks,nothing stands in our way. We're still running, we are not afraid.The thrill is on, speed up without any breaks.Cause sometimes we still have to hit the wall.See things that are right before our eyes. We fear nothing, we fear nothing.Lifelong, road blocks, high walls, teardrops,nothing stands in our way.Bloodstain, star crash, mistakes, heartbreaks,nothing stands in our way.
It's a fairy tale, and the story's out of dateNothing that I have or try to sayKnow that that the road is lonelyI will need some helpKnow that this life is crazyI will need some help There's a place far belowThe darkness deep withinIt's a place I don't belongCome set me free from this oblivion On the side of meOn the edge of agonyNothing left for me that I can fake You know that the road is lonelyI will need some helpYou know that this life is crazyI will need some help There's a place far belowThe darkness deep withinIt's a place I don't belongCome set me free from this oblivion It's a fairy tale, and the story's out of dateNothing that I have or try to sayAnd I... I keep wondering awayI'm so deep in disarrayI keep wondering There's a place far belowThe darkness deep withinIt's a place I don't belongCome set me free, set me free I keep wondering (set me free)I keep wondering (set me free)I keep wondering (set me free. come set me free, set me free) I keep wondering (Set me free)I keep wondering (Set me free)I keep wondering (Come set me free from this oblivion)
Sometimes the Sun shines coldThe road is lonely as I walk aloneIn the sky the clouds are racing fastIt's becoming so cold outside Time has comeTime has come And the clouds gather above me As I stand in the rain of this cold dayTears are the words when I cannot confess the painTime will heal but I don't want to feel Sometimes it's hard to let goIt's hard to move along the scars of lifeMemories are blooming in the gloomAs I'm feeling so cold inside Cry in the rainRelease the pain So cry nowCry now and let it go
Clock is ticking while I'm killing timeSpinning all around nothing else they can do to turn it backBreaking partnership in this crimeRipping up the past, condescending smile[Chorus:]Time to forgetThe falling of my truthTime to forgetOur ways of our truthCome and tease meClock is ticking while I'm still in timeCan't you turn it back?Stop the cycle set me free, run awaySilence sneaking around my pathWrap the rope off me, feeling like we'll flyFeeling like we'll fly[Chorus: x2]
I cannot fight against myselfNo moreSelf destruction that I predictedNot a long time agoPetrifiedThoughts so far from meThe power of my justice blows me awayIt's just the case to repeatWhat I've never said to you beforeCelebrateI'm alive againYou don't expect from meThis chain reactionYou can't imagine from meThis great affectionSee the structure of my prideWasn't easy to build it away from thisI never walked away from youI never walked aloneA pleasure makes me vibe again tonightI'm just thinking how fine it is to feel myself so fine againCelebrateI'm alive againIt's time to turn the page and startAnd thenDon't you think that it's timeTo convince yourself it's over?CelebrateI'm alive again
I have you in my dreams at nightYou were holding my handsThen I awake and you're not mineNow it's time to riseI want to turn cold ice in my soulGot to freeze this yearning insideWhen you're inflicted byThe passion of loveDesire and yearning theDeeper they burnYou were...Now it's too lateYou were...Now you're goneIt's too lateI was wrongIt's my fate"I think of you and I see meI'm the one I thought I've never beI feel dirty - no purityDesire and yearning in you heartNo mercy for you no mercy for me."
I'll never waste another daySearching to find the reasonWhy did I choose to play this gameThis goes too farI'll take no moreI played the part and took the blameWhile you pretend nothing is realLife turned to night as you're asleepBlood flowing down, is this a dream?Liar, you tempt meI don't know what to doNo guilt is in my heartI don't know what to doI'm not the reasonI'll never waste another dayForever lostNo reasonHe never choose to play this gameTaken too far out of controlLiar, you tempt meI don't know what to doNo guilt is in my heartI don't know what to doI'm not the reason

My time moves slowlyGliding across the veil of my nude skinIf I should cross the border you made for meMaybe i would not be here But not what sense does it make To try and embrace a more pristine pastLooking forward I will take the riskBut I'll find answers to my why's All that you will beHas already been writtenIf he truly existsThis god has failed Every word pronounedWill be the mirror of your painReflecting the blameFeeding the hate Mother I'll choose my destinyIf I'm able to resist I am still standing in this moment of pure madnessI don't know anymore if I should desire good or evilAlthough sin maybe gives me more But now what sense does it makeTo try to resist a written destinyI'm not going to sit back and watchWithout trying to resist you Waking me up Mother I'll choose my destinyIf I'm able to resist Waking me up There's no choice without meThere's no life without me
You can see the eyes, the source of my day QuestionI'll try to resistA way for sorry QuestionIt tries to fade awayDon't like dreaming,I see you crying I believe in a power of my dreamsFeeling all the confusion, sold my soulBut I live in another side of meBut I'm desperate to see* Deep in your lies there's a star,Deep inside of my eyes You're feeling for the last timeAll this is a wayYou want to live for the last timeWaiting for a wayYou're dreaming all the last nightAll this is a wayYou want to live for the last timeWaiting for a way You fade awayDeep inside of me You're feeling for the last timeAll this is a wayYou want to live for the last timeWaiting for a wayYou're dreaming all the last nightAll this is a wayYou want to live for the last timeWaiting for a way Come forth from the depths of the darkest abyss,Bring ti me my darkest dreamsAnihilate the hope from which I singTo find a light as dark as theseAs dark as these shades of nightThat seek to destroy the darkest lifeThus yet I stand, alone, and fearlessPain comes and I am tearless. - Bloodrite (www.freewebs.com/bloodrite)

Is it asking too much to be given timeTo know these songs and to sing themIs it asking too much of my vacant smileAnd my laugh and lies that bring themBut as the stars are going outAnd this stage is full of nothingAnd the friends have all but goneFor my life my god I'm singingWe'll take our hearts outsideLeave our lives behindI'll watch the stars go outIs it asking too much of my favorite friendsTo take these songs for realIs it asking too much of my partner's handsTo take these songs realIs it asking too muchIs it asking too much
I just need you absolutelyAll the fears in your mindI just want you absolutelyTo sail this ship of mineI don't know what the hell you're saying'cause you're going blindUsing all the lies they told youTo hurt your mindAnd I can breathe now...It's there, pretends to be a guide for youLike a candle in the darkLies like a really cold breeze in the airStep by step you'll lose your faithI just need you miserablyBroken man come to meI just need you desperatelyJust want to change your mind
Sometimes I feel alone in a million crowdAn outside wandering alone withoutAny words to say, they can't explainThe desire to overcome the painFeel the breath that's always getting awayAm I dreaming it all? I will never be afraid[Chorus:]I'll survive, in this nothing leading nowhereI'll survive, feeling stronger for how much longer?I'll survive, in this nothing leading nowhereI'll survive, I surviveA voice inside of me that keeps on teasingAs sweet as like a whisper from the lips of painAnd so many steps that I can't makeI can't take the chance, release the breakAnd the breath just keeps on getting awayAm I dreaming it all? I will never be afraid[Chorus: x2]

Delighthing mindsWith my shadowRely on your way to growYou want to decideFrom your cloudYou're lost in a worldThat I have to repairYou want it allThe greatest smileWho wants to deny forever?You're made of iceI pay the priceFor all you unforgivenessEnlighting liesWith my shameBeneath the veilOf your flowDon't try to denyWith your mouthSo fine it is knowingYou're under the shade
While emotions try to come outDesperately I seek in their pathA way so I cannot be outdoneAnd to finish this search for the meaningTo hide emotions cause a blow outDesperately I seek their blastA way so I cannot be outdoneAnd to finish this search for the meaningI'm going to freezeIs it my imagination?It's undergroundBut I can feel it the sameWhat I need nowWhat I need is to live to hideWhen you smothered my devotionWith your liesAnd I feel nowAs I did that timeThat I'm wondering whyStill I make you cryWhile emotions try to come outDesperately I seek their pathA way so I cannot be outdoneAnd to finish this search for the meaningTo hide emotions cause to blow outDesperately I seek their blastA way so I cannot be outdoneAnd to finish this search for the meaningSuffering while I'm depending on seasonsRoots under me are embracing the earth
I was born in another worldstrictly connected to a piece of my mindnothing more than a little landit is a small cradle where I'm a kidI am the princess in there,nothing wrong in my fantasy worldI am the king, the nation,no dictators or religionsno laws laid down for meI have my own liberty inside of menothing to lose, I want to live hereAs you see I'm the only survivor in this landWhen did I hear this wind beforechange like this to a deeper roar?I'm starting to bleed another wayI just need some time to complete myselfthese spotlights are here againI can't see anything, I'm blindthis nature of time and spacemakes me sick of the situationI couldn't know if I...if I will be strong enough for thisI have to choose, do I want to live here?
Here I start to define itAs a sign on my skin that I just try to wash awayReminderInfected, it'll be painful to meLife is so shortClose to the edge of another backdoorLife is so sure!Life will be ready to twist up your worldHere it starts to enlightenThere's a frame I can't change that I just have to watch againReminderRepressed inside me, it keeps repeatingLife is so shortClose to the edge of another backdoorLife is so sure!Life will be ready to twist up your worldLife is so shortClose to the edge of another backdoorLife is so sure!Life will be ready to twist up your world

What a dayI can barely keep my eyes wide openI don't wanna see straightWhat a dayFeels like my breath is heavy againAnd I'm totally fadedCome to meCome to meI am waiting for youCome to meI can't waitFollow me, follow meAs I trip the darknessOne more timeFollow me, follow meI awake from madnessJust in timeWhat a daySeconds, minutes and hours spill overFind More lyrics atThere's no time here in spaceWhat a dayI see beauty in everythingBut the world is still fading awayWhat a dayI can barely keep my eyes wide openI don't wanna see straightWhat a daySeconds, minutes and hours spill overThere's no time here in spaceCome to me come to meCome to me come to meCome to me come to meI am waiting for you

Here is nothing up aheadOr down the roadThe streets won't last foreverThere is nothing left to looseI cannot seeMyself inside this dreamI knowNothing lasts foreverNothing lasts foreverUnchainedI'm like a bullet set free nowUnchainedI'm like a weapon unleashed nowNow I've found my wayTo solid groundI left behind the feelingThat I've been a foolI feel much stronger nowI am not the sameYou knowNothing lasts foreverNothing lasts forever
You are going downYou are going downYou are going downDownAt the bottom I have foundI cannot wait to get back in the fightAnd send you straight to the groundHide and seekWhen I'm on the ropesYou wanna knock me down, knock me outYour cheap shots are deniedYou're going downYou can't kill my soul and kill me dreamBack downNowYou will understand me nowYou don't want to come back to the fightI've been the underdog all my lifeI can feel itI will not stop until I see you downOn the groundCause I am still alive
And it doesn't matterHow you feel now, anything at allSeems to be your only way, so viciousHeavenly apartWhen your envy is on a piece of paperLet me sweetly smileYou're devouring all the crumbI'm leaving caught up in your liesYou're on any other sideClawing up my eyesI'm feeling your arms around meOn the other sideIt's time to goI'm hearing your voiceWithout wordsOn the other sideBut it doesn't matterHow I feel now, anything at allSince I've left you with the wrongImpression while I'm still the sameWhen I turn around and lookAt my life, shadows in disguiseBut I'm working onAn interruption of hypocrisyYou're an any other sideClawing up my eyesI'm feeling your arms around meOn the other side, it's time to goI'm hearing your voice without wordsOn the other sideAny other side
I don't understand I don't know what to doOnce again I feel to even realizeThey're person what you think for meIt doesn't care it doesn't seeI don't listen anymoreDon't try to change your life with mineI'm living the ?upside downLaughing at my disasterI'm living the ? upside downLaughing at my disasterI don't understand why you feel confusedOnce again you felt to even realizeThe person that you think of meI don't care what you believeIt doesn't listen anymoreDon't try to change your life with mineI'm living the ? upside downLaughing at my disasterI'm living the ? upside downLaughing at my disasterI don't understand why you feel confusedOnce again you felt to even realizeI'm living the ? upside downLaughing at my disasterI'm living the ? upside downLaughing at my disasterUpside down, upside downUpside down, upside down
These ghosts I keep insideShards of glass in my veinsRelease me from myself, releaseFrom my dualityI face these as a soldier wouldBut useless is my warThe innocence that smiles todayTomorrow will bee lyingWho is it that really dies when all the people look at me?And I'm twisting my fingers in my hairWhile a mirror reflects meNow I'm digging to the boneAll the paintingScratching at flesh, drives me madTo be alive and freeAnd the ghosts I keep inside myselfHow do they see me?While again I'm drowningWith my soul will you save me?
Stumbling I almost fall Walking blind in this decay It's sending shivers down my spine again Can't be running for our lives We're still fighting for our land Fight for something we don't understand We need to free ourselves now Then become more human We will not stand in line Victims have fallen in vain Frozen hearts Empty eyes We've seen it all before We will not stand in line Victims have fallen in vain Mother's tears Vicious eyes We've seen it all before People told me I was weak I told them I'll never quit I will never quit (I'll never) Never break me down Never break me down again We need to free ourselves now Then become just human I don't want to hear no more The rotten lies I heard before Never break me down again I cannot burn inside this hell Vengeance I think it's taking over me Vengeance You'll never run away from me
I saw you fadeOr was it a dreamBut sooner had I tried to touch youThe love would disappearHard to go onYou'll never let me down againHard to go onAnd never be the one to blameThe causeFloating into your worldTo see what is insidePassing what you've lived throughThe peace is out of sightCan't stay awayCan't stay away from you x2Hard to go onYou'll never let me down againHard to go onAnd never be the one to blameThe causeFloating into your worldTo see what is insidePassing what you've lived throughThe peace is out of sightCan't stay awayCan't stay away from you x2(Background vocals)And now I miss youWhenever you appear to meAnd now I feel youWhenever I can't stay away from youThe cause
There is something weird I wouldn't believeI'm losing grip on my lifetimeI don't understand this wave I'm inWrong place, no money, just responsibilitiesMy heart and my wish are so far awayI'm alone nowFeeling the slow beat turning fastNo longer breathingI', returning in my own hellI don't want to goHold me into your arms so tightYou cannot seeYou'll see itIn another worldHold me into your arms so tightYou cannot see itYou'll seeThere is something strangeYou've got to believeIt's taking away my sunshineI don't understand this wave I'm inWrong face, no money, just responsibilities

ParanoiaIn which I think that I'm not confidentBlood into my hands I can't denyA buzz into my ears that makes me madBut I don't look backWhile I'm waiting to dieI don't look backIn a weird lullabyI'll carry onAnd the hope in my heart is dryBut I don't look backAnd I cannot replyI don't look backWhile I'm waiting to lieI'll carry onWhile they want to decide for meOnce againLiving in their cageThey are killing meParanoiaIn which I think I'm not that confidentA tiny hope that burns into my breathA bitter smile delights me at the end
The rebel inside a mind of my ownI haven't felt right since the moment that I gave upI challenged my limits, I'm feeling I'm becoming limitlessI take it all and inhaleI'm wide awakeI open my eyes and the sky's so blueAll of a sudden I know that I treasure my lifeI find myself wide awake like youThe struggle within now I understandFreedom begins when you get out of the cage you builtIt looks like I'm crazy but I know I'm not the only oneTo believe in myself, believe in myself, I won't becoming undone'Cause I feel like I'm wide awakeI open my eyes and the sky's so blueAll of a sudden I know that I treasure my lifeI find myself wide awake like youI'm wide awakeI open my eyes and the sky's so blueAll of a sudden I know that I treasure my lifeAll of a sudden I know that I treasure my lifeLike you
Something about you that makes me feel badI wasn't there when a thin line destroyed your soulI search every cornerThere's nowhere to hideHow I feel ignoranceSacrifice some days it's harderLet's face it, it's all about meDeeply into your own[Chorus]Deep within meLife's crawling and wasting my daysAnother night gone and I know there will be another wayI'm leading myself to be freeIn this eternal goodbyeSomething about you will make me strongerNow I'm aware when a man falls rebound, my faultI search every cornerJust nowhere to hideHow I feel ignoranceSacrifice some days it's harderLet's face it, it's all about meDeeply into your own[Chorus]Here I wanna beNo more lies![Chorus]
Will you wash my feet againWith the tears I've cried out?Will you save me from my selfishness? Feels like talking to a wallIn this universe I'm lostAs I keep on searchingOn and on without a reason Here I come to show you,Our path it is your heartI'm melting into youOur destiny so cruel In the journey of my existenceI felt strong in my believesCould I find a better way toThis reality? Feels like talking to a wallIn this universe I'm lostAs I keep on searchingOn and on without a reason Here I come to show you,Our path it is your heartI'm melting into youOur destiny so cruel Feels like talking to a wallFeels like talking to a wall I'm melting into youOur destiny so cruel Feels like talking to a wallFeels like talking to a wallFeels like talking to a wallFeels like talking to a wall

If in a weak man New answers are long to appear Invisible, distant  Inevitable awakening  Inside of me there is nothing Of immobile faith, nothing  Here I am I'm giving myself to you Without fear  Invisible distances They'll forever recall a farewell  Inside of me there is nothing Of immobile faith, nothing  Inside of me there is nothing Of immobile faith, nothing  Inside of me there is nothing Of immobile faith, nothing
Words that no one understandsI here these words In my headYou know where they talk about About the dead(about the dead)They told me Ineeded to killThey told they will be with me Words that no one understandsI hear these words in a rimeI hear these words all the timeThere's no way to Escape They told me I don't need to be afraid of themThey told me i was scaredI don't know how they know those thingsThey hold me in the darknessI'm hopeless Words that no one understandsI hear these words in a rimeI hear these words all the timeThere's no way to Escape Then you came and wishper to meBelieve In me Words that no one understandsI hear these words in a rimeI hear these words all the timeThere's no way to Escape Words that no one understandsI hear these words in a rimeI hear these words all the timeThere's no way to Escape
