Growing up in extreme poverty, and living in a town filled with empty promises, the young boy is filled with scepticism. He battles between right and wrong. Facing a horrifying decision, which no child should have to make, his whole life could be turned upside down. Does he listen to the wishes of his kind, but stressful mother, to remain living in poverty, and be persecuted by many? The alternative is to take a road into crime and deception, with his so called friends. Either way he'll suffer the consequences.[Verse] His mother sad, now she's left alone No shoulder to cry on, no hand to hold To stay alive, worked her fingers to the bone Guilt nor shame, her child must have a homeShe tried to teach him right from wrong A town without vision, they don't belong Eternal friends, persuasive lies Tainted images, through sorry eyes[Bridge]Don't be shy, pull up a stool, stick with us You'll do okay Money talks, that's their rule, Once you join, you're here to stay you can't walk away[Chorus]Lord knows she tried hard to save him The angel without wings[Verse]Stigmatised, the poor, the few Opportunities given, but not to you He searched along the corridors of power A fruitless journey, his darkest hour [Bridge]By any rule he doesn't play, Now he's the keeper, no-one's fool Who said crime doesn't pay All his fears have disappeared[Chorus]Lord knows she tried so hard, to save him Lord knows she tried so hard, to save him[Middle-8]The angel without wings Time, will it tell, a choice of heaven or hell[Repeat chorus][Outro]The years have passed by, the leaves have fallen Learn to survive in time, you're on your own 
The morning winds carries the guild of the night Hands it out and sighs, angel like faces conseal Masters and slaves, driven by the same  Caught in a world built on lies, left to rhyme Given place and time, to fill up the gaps in your life Silence bears the shame  Can you remember the time life was worth The beauty of the word No diamonds could steal it away  It was your life you see, Forced into history, pushed back in time I am your destiny I feed you, disease you, I am your world  Capture the spirit, so open your mind Listen to reason before you decide, Money won't buy all the things you desire The future lies wide open  WAR Greed and illusions, all caught in the fight Darkness faces light  Can you remember the time life was worth The struggle of a birth No demons could steal it away  It was your life you see Forced into history, pushed back in time I am your destiny I feed you, decease you, I am your world  [Chorus]  Build your walls up high For angels grace you cry  Capture the spirit, so open your mind Listen to reasons before you decide Money won't buy all the things you desire The future lies wide open  FIGHT Fight of the fever The capitol guide  It's not your life you see Let it be history, way back in time  Love is your destiny It greeds you, it feeds you This is your world  [Chorus]

Hiding in fearSuch abnormalityClose your eyes now, say a prayerMemories, a punishment so realThey played their cold and isolated gamesGames, that wicked children playedThey made you feel afraidParalyzed, a child's imaginationLostYou're caught inside a spellSubconsciously afraidThe answer lies, behind the tearsFightDon't hide away you're strongEnough to face the truthWhich hides behind, behind the tearsReality, it comes in shapes and formsConcentration, chase those fears awayThought a power, the power to be freeThink positive the pain will disappear
Don't you worry he won't be back here anymoreTry a little harder go as far as you can goA state of tolerance something which you'll never knowThe mind has a way of playing games and twisting your realityYou're hooked like a fish and deep inside lies the painHe's longing for reality no more abnormalitySo sad to say you're no one's child reflection is a part of youAn' come what may your nations wild are killing youMore and more like a drug you're longing for who's it forFor pity sake, god knows whoNowhere to turn too no one here that wants youStay far away now way beyond normalityNo one to talk too, talkin' cannot help you stay far away nowYou've stepped beyond realityWhere limitations have no place the more extreme the more you doYou most certainly won't stand a chance of pulling through
[Chorus]I gave you freedom, don't hand me your painA lover's heart burning, now has vanished in the flamesOur kind of love was to strange to comprehendIt's beauty as fragile as circles in the sandMaybe one morning comes,And I can see it clearly in the skyShining in my eyesYour soul is a temple, all secrets retainedAnd why share your feelings when you have the worldTo blameSurrounded by water, your problems are oh so deepYou're swimming a lifetime,But there ain't no land to seeMaybe one morning comesAnd you can see it clearly in the skyShining in your eyes[Chorus]I can see, but can you seeI can hear reality, knocking upon my doorCan't take it anymore,Words left unspoken, not to returnThe mind is a weapon, a way to suppressBut how can I blame you, for you had no place to crashKeep hope for the future and hold the strawend tightDefeat isn't final when there's still a way to fightAnd then the morning comesAnd you can see it clearly in the skyShining in your eyes[Chorus]
Close your eyes, love will come your wayClose your eyes tonight
You took the step and slipped awayEnchanted by a friendly faceYou thought it was loveIt took your life out of your handsYou never dreamt that it would ever and never endBought and soldShould have seen it from the startHe stole your love and broke your heartLove out on displayAmong your shattered dreams you standMake a reason out of hollow wordsWhat's it worth[Chorus]
My memories clear as ever of a little boyI can see myself so full of wander a child so full of joyIn a field oh way up yonder not so far from homeLived a sweet old man called Mr.Wonder because of dreams he toldHe once so philosophically explainedThere's a reason we're brought into this worldI wish he was with us today pray hear me say I understand nowNo matter how how hard we try we never listen when destiny's callingWe still keep changing our lives stop, look and listenIt's destiny calling you (when destiny's calling you)Looking back remissing changes long gone byOpportunities I keep on missing I've stared 'em in the eyeThe gravity of all my actions I try hard to disguiseIt became crystal clear we change the future affecting all our livesAn old man philosophically explainedThere's a reason we're brought into this worldFunny those words that he said will always be true forever and everEach promise we break the choice is yours and mineEach wrong move that we make we're missing chancesEach step with each day will get harder, harder if we go our own way
Responsibility and blame, tall orders madeAffecting the lives of your friends, for whom you careSerious doubts withinA nightmarish tale look what you've doneA sacrifice means many thingsDetermined you won't give inThe answer is loud and clearAgainst all the odds you're determined to winA simple solution existsSuch loyalty and trust you gaveTo all your friendsImpossibilities, this task you faceSolutions for everyoneThe perfect resolve can it be foundLoyalty and trust, both you gaveSimplicity a saving grace, as clear as dayDon't be cruel to be kind, just change your waysSearching your soul insideYour nightmarish tale has finally gone
[Instrumental]
Under a moonless sky, I stood, I laughed, I crySeasons turned to tears, as I fought the yearsThis shattered soul of mine, has got a thousend sidesRemind me to win when the morning ringsDon't hope...[Chorus]Should I take it on my knees?In waves it comes...It washes over me, it carries me alongWill it leave me when I'm gone?I'm so young, I'm too young...help me...Now when I close my eyes,I see the eyes of faithThey burn in my faceA thousend lies, oh why...Leave my soul to bleedWon't you erase me?Go where the sceptre swaysIt rules it's reign, I pray for the end of time,Now I've crossed the line, don't hope...Don't hope...[Chorus]Now when I close my eyes, I realize the truthNo more lies, look at the sun for the last timeMy friendsThe final paradeWon't you erase me...
What you see you must not touch, what you seeWhat you want you cannot have, what you wantAs Adam plucked the apple from the tree he never realisedA chemical and biological attraction, came to beConsummate, your one desirePhysically connect as oneTo copulate, will quench the fireBurning fiercely in the soul and mindWhat you wantYou know you can't touchWhat you seeYou know you can't haveWhat you needIt's just what you feelWhat you can't haveYou want more and moreOnce you've had a taste you're hypnotizedForbidden fruit resist the callAn appetite, to self-indulgeKeep's growing stronger by the dayYour self-control, you're bound to loseIf you continue in this feverish wayOnce you've had a taste you're hypnotizedForbidden fruit resist the callDon't be drawn into it's sweet desiresForbidden fruit can change it's formEverything is spiritual, everything has a spirit, everything is brought to you by the creatorAs Adam plucked the apple from the tree he never realisedA chemical and biological attraction, came to beWhy, why did man create all of these things?
[Van der Laars/Parry]Known well and favouredThere's no limit to his charmThis illusive adversary, unforeseeable consequencesAbsurd behaviour, a macabre like frame of mindLiving for the moment, not a care in the worldExcuses one and more' proclamations he'll makeYou must, beware' a hand and arm he'll takeHe'll disregard us allThough in thee we trustLead us not to temptationHelp us one and allIn the company of a force majeureLead us, lead us not' beyond the realms of our salvationNo sacrifice is more' than following a force majeureEach vow is broken, it's a total waste of lifeAn urge to lead us on, irresistible strange compulsionsEuphoric notions, superior in kindSo irresponsible, for the fun of it all
Four walls, a ceiling, and a constant fear of the unknown.Driven by a mother's instinct to protect her child,her worst nightmares materialize before her very eyes.A constant fear she hasA mother's instinct to protectHis innocence her child, must not be influencedSurreal nightmares they appearBefore her very eyesThe walls start closing in, then the madness beginsThe consequences of her actionsInto a life of stress he cameFrenzy, frenzyOn the edge of a nervous breakdownA living hell, going crazy Frenzy, frenzyThe unknown, eats your soul aliveYour heart pounds, your blood is boilingIn her chaotic mindThe darkest secrets she would tellAnd smothered them with tales,Not for othersA psychological affect, she'd createdCaused the child to change, he was never the sameAll the king's horses and all the king's menTelling insane stories over again

[Helmantel/Bruinenberg/Parry]D'you ever get the feeling that, you're never welcomeYou walked into a place feel the atmosphere changeMy body's trembling, I sense a presence strange withinA ghostly silence, a place for the living deadIcehouse... a sanctuary for strangersWhere evil's waitingIcehouse... your darkest secrets are knownIn this icehouse... a pure demoralizationA cold frustrationIcehouse... darkness glowsNo sign of life, the air you breathe is thick and frozenA shallow grave awaits, a home for the living deadDon't venture in, you'll just regret this sight appallingIt feeds on frightened souls, the lost and the weak of heart
According to you, just a matter of time, Me falling on my knees.Make place in the end of the line. You've got the tools I wanted to steal, Guaranteed a steamy night.I heard it from too many guys. Why anticipate, hiding in the shade.Watching the big love pass by. I'm no fool, I'm no fool for you.I've waited too long, had to go on, So don't say I've left you behind.I'm no fool, I'm no fool for you. Reaching for a new horizon, Leaving past in silent shame, Out of this world of fantasy. I watched you move, night and day, Breaking through my walls of pain.Ooh now I'll break away. GET OUT first you lead me on, Now you throw me away.GET OUT leave me be, I want out.

I'm a stranger, even to myself.Living in this masquerade.As time passed by, all that remained is pain.More than I can cope with. In my dreams I hear you say, "Please come running to me baby"If I could turn back time. It's hard to live another day. Witout you.You seemed so young and touch and so strong.It's a long and lonely road in the labyrinth of dreams.Caught in the labyrinth of dreams. Isolation, now there's no one there, To wipe away my bitter tears.It rules my mind, your spirit haunts me time and timeAgain.More than I can live with. They say that time will ease the pain, But I'll keep running to you bay.I I could turn back time. It's hard to live another day. Witout you.You seemed so young and touch and so strong.It's a long and lonely road in the labyrinth of dreams. Solo It's hard to live another day. Witout you.You seemed so young and touch and so strong.It's a long and lonely road in the labyrinth of dreams.Caught in the labyrinth of dreams.

Good morning my son, watch the sun topping your dream.In the future a future to see.Morning or not, it's always too late.Why do we live in the past?A moment is just long enough for the next to erase.[Bridge:]A fading dimension, with a link to the soul.It feels like, no freedom, but life to go.[Chorus:]I - Hide the poet in silence.AM - Where the whisper still screams.LOST - Like a storm on the ocean.FIND MESON - To my inner emotions.TO - Kill the time on its way.ME - Bringing lies to the notion.[Bridge:]You're blessed with the power of seeing,What for others remains.The violence, the torment, with who to blame?Take a look at my life,Encounter the ways protected by time.It's buying, supplying and taking lives.Take a look at this face,The present disgust, tomorrows disgrace.We're hiding, denying we're stuck to race.
Do you watch the shadows, dancing on your wallDo you float in silence, praying for the night to fallBaby, had to believe. I'm holding on forever, you're in my golden armsI slowly suffocate you, with my lucky charmsWhy don't I set you free[Chorus]When I close your eyes rememberThere might not be another dayI hold you in my heart,And I knew it from the startBut I couldn't let it winI saw it in your eyes No lust for lifeWhen you sleep you're crying, maybe you wish for deathWhen you look you're hiding, don't look away againWhere does it endThere is a star descending, you reach and toughThe lightYour earthly body's fading, swallowed up byThe nightDown in the dark I stand. [Chorus]
Captivated by his addiction for over indulgence,His abuse of people touches the very coreOf what mankind perceives as being uncivilised.Hatred, like an infection, spreads from one victim to another.The resulting factor is a broken spirit; a shadow of his former self.Suffocating in his own remorse, he fears the unexpected.His nervousness takes a form of it's own.It manifests and takes control.To him it's real.He's unaware that his mind has shut out his surroundings.Isolated and alone, he starts to fear, fear itself.You know what they say, your many victimsWhat comes around, goes aroundOver indulgence, uncivilizedUncertainty, created your discontentHis spirit is broken, lives in a world unrealAn infectious hatredSee how it feelsNow look at youManifestation of fearMan's own creationManifestation of fearThe mind's exaggerationFirst the unexpected, then the unexplainedBeing a victim, that makes him so afraidThe resulting factor, his fear's coming aliveSilently, he's slowly suffocatingHis spirit is broken, lives in a world unrealSuffer gods children, see how it feelsNow look at youLocked away, all aloneHe doesn't know what to expectAfraid of fear, fear itselfTo manifest, taking control
On the surface things look differentWhat's underneath you cannot tellFor years it seems that everything is going wellBehind the laughter hides a mysteryShrouded in a friendly veilThe moment when you're making progressAll things failA challenge to be solved, they can't resistThe chaseTheir masqueradeThis dangerous path you're on, what if your instinct's wrongBeware the wrath of a patient manDanger, dangerDanger LiesClose beside, close beside youDanger, danger, close besideWaiting to take you awayWhat we perceive as being normalA twisted mind won't stipulateTo occupy their genius a masqueradeWay down a no-where road you're driftingInto a no-where place you'll stayMake a wish pray someone's listening, night and day
Obsessed with dominance, he crushes each person who innocently crosses his path. His adrenalin thrives on a need to destroy basis. His skill to deceive gains him vast wealth and fortune. However any trace of his original character or identity vanishes into oblivion.[Verse]No compromise, no words can make him see He's elevated to a higher levelTo feed a need, let the adrenalin flow A warped sensation, deceit is blissful[Bridge]Mystified by lies, demoralizing No second glance, face to face Thru' those naked eyes, captivating He'll suck you dry, and leave no trace[Chorus]Once inside your head, the captive mind his game Manipulates his way, terrorizing Secrets kept alive, subconscious thoughts awake Watch him take control, hypnotizing[Verse]A master of, pure deception His testimony that, that he's a freak of nature[Repeat bridge & chorus][Ad-libs]Take a look into those eyes And I can tell you what you'll see 
Gradually he no longer hates the world, nor himself.Once the epitome of all that's evil, now is a guiding light.His reformation, to put right his wrong doings.Thus he is able, together with the strength from a kind heart,to search out the damaged souls from his wicked past.Not only to repay them in money,but also to give the reassurance and belief,that mankind has the ability to change for the good.Infantile dillusion, played the biggest partAnger caused confusionA childhood fear, of fear itselfMere mortals playing godIt's time to stop, feel the yearningMother Nature's calling you, a metamorphosis workingYour body's aching all the timeA shadow lurkingYour saviour's waiting in the wingsNight turns to day, only shame remains realTake their misery away, redeemHeal the pain they feelA chance to turn it all around, a time for sharingBury your fears into the groundMet-a-morphosisPut your hatred aside, hear the callingMetamorphosisA transformation of kind forming, a season of good is dawningPut away those evil thoughtsOpen up your heart and breatheMet-a-morphosisPut your hatred aside, hear the callingMetamorphosisA transformation of kind, a season of good is dawningHear the calling, have no fear!The cries of tomorrow, was all you could hearBut the road you have chosen, has wiped away the tearsSilence is golden - silence is real.
Seems like yesterday, you walked into my life and sweptMy heart away. Way out of line, I couldn't hear you lie it's like a trick of the mind.Let me tell you mama, the best things in lifeSuppose to be fare and you ought to be mine.Down here on my knees, begging you please, Please go after someone who you really need. You're out of my world, but you go where everI try to make a new start with life.Baby haven't you heard, you're over and outOver and outLike the day before, you opened up my heartNow it won't close no more. Day after day, Looking at the future in a devious way.I'm not heartless guy, Cause mine did some healing.I don't care if you cry.So listen to me honey, to my innercall, Don't wanna kick the bucket better than a walk.
The night that the eye of heaven shines Down mountains of hope and joy we glide The best wasn't good enough, all had to greed for more Took our hand and our soul as well; dwell in the dark Intrigued by a ghostly light divine Engaged in our bodily delight But we had to sail along, to where the story ends Took the time, just to find that there ain't no way back [Chorus] Who believes in reason, age of common sence Poisened hearts of black and white It's grey we are drowning in While chocking in tiny bits of life It's flashing in memories through our minds Why we had to sing the song, we knew was wrong inside Out of tune, there's no key to those who pray for you [Chorus] All our dreams, we left them for... Mysteries with velvet claws All that seemed right to need, It's gone
[Instrumental] [Music: Chris Allister & Henk van der Laars][All his devious actions escalate into an atmosphere of absolute mistrust.]

Having taken a path of no return, he develops a personality of power,And turns supreme manipulation into an art form.On the surface he portrays a person being of caring and consideration,While his dark side hides calmly, until the moment of truth can appear.Full of charm, so open mindedLets you talk 'till you're blue in the faceCompassion sincereHis own portrayal, the proud example to othersWhen in fact, a covenant he's madeWith the dark side of hellWait! Don't be fooled by himStop! don't go near himHis appearance can change, like the chameleonWe're all his helpless subjectsAnd like his damaged toysOnce they're of no importanceWith savage grace destroysSo supreme, a master to manyAn' acts like a friend, offers comfort to allPatiently, telling wild fabricationsGaining your trust the thrill, the thrill of it allGet ready to run!
The day the war was over, so the story goesYou could hear the church bells ring hear the laughterBut with hope and glory, lingers memoriesIn the dark a girl would dance with her shadowsFirst she lose her father in the burning debrisSorrow took her mother so castly so she wasBrought up in a house of strangersMany years went by so her torment grew a place where children mustn't cryNot a soul to talk too she created her friends through a room lit viewHand in hand but never shy, the silent fewLocked in a room the walls were closing inIt shocked her system from within so she lies staring at the images insideShadow dancer in the dark it's O.K. to shed a tearRemember time to forget shadow dancer in the darkLet the shadows disappear shed a tear now, and time will do the rest
I lie awake in bedWondering why, I can't hear a thingThe world outside, seems unusually quietI listen, but I can't hear I noise Oh, it's not possibleA world full of people all contentNo rich or poor, just a fairytaleTry to imagineHow wonderful, life could feel I sense a presence in the airI can feel it all aroundA kind of silence in the wind A peaceful energy to shareI can almost touch it seems so realThe sound of silence in the wind I'm not too old, just an ordinary chapWho wants to make a wishA special dream come trueCall me naive, call it innocenceBut I bet that's just the way you're feeling to The sound of silence in the... The sound of silence in the wind
Paranoia slowly starts to take effect.His huge fortune has created many enemies.In haste he searches for solitude.Secluded from the outside world, he lives in a fragile sense of security. Locked away he hopes to find peace of mind,But instead he's haunted by the terrifying images in his dreams.Images of those whose lives he so mercilessly helped to destroy. All of that money you've madeFrom all of those souls with their lives they've paid nowLost your pride, locked insideWhere's the light at the end of the road Blame and sorrowNo more day, just, tomorrowClose the door, turn the keyLock the misery away!You're living in an ivory tower All of the guilt you should feel when all of the torment you caused was realTruth you've found, changed your madeAt the end of the road there's a light So many places, hidden lies, saddened facesClose the door take the key, try and throw it away far, far away In a solitary dayThere's a solitary point of viewHide the fear away!That's the price you have to pay They're coming to get you, put boards on your windowsIt won't take 'em long 'till they find out a wayDon't sleep stay awake now, look over your shoulderYour enemy's coming to take you away! In a solitary day, there's a solitary point of viewHide your fear away, it strips away the good in you

When I look at myself frustration I try to hideWhen it cries cries out in vain then I can't resist or hideMy state of mind state of mindNow the feelings from within tell the tale a life of sinAn' a cold journey through timeI don't recall memories hard to focus hard to pleaseAm I losing my mindA psychological impulse twisting around insideMy state of mind an out of body experience my state of mindA separation between the soul and mind to be as one with each otherA state of mind in control of my helplessThe weirdest things always happen could it be my penanceA mnemonic phase that I resistNow the feelings dark within me my sins will never ever be freeOn and on and on we go we live our lives but never showThe knowledge guilt we all possess the strength of mind to now confess
Take a good look around tell us a truth now what are they sayingThey're out of all sight and sound while the hatred is growingThe guilty are prayingThough innocent eyes don't lie it's hopeless subscribing retaliationEnemies all must die is this the road to hell and damnationWon't somebody help them anymore like a rock to the groundThey keep falling just when they found a real sense of DirectionWe determine our own lives with the power the strength to change themBut when manipulation plays a big part then our future is goneSuppression won't we bother suppression won't we show a little concernRepression won't we help each other only if we can find the time my dearSo what lessons if any can be learnt to help your sister to help your brotherOr do we turn a blind eye 'cause no one we know ever gets hurt

[Van der Laars/Bruinenberg/Parry] Watch out... I feel the strainArms in the air, pointing at meNo doubt... am I to blameI swear it's the truth, my life's not a game Against the wall...Waiting for someone to come, and crucify meI'll take it all...If humiliation is worse, than all the pain Sweet revenge is all they seekNever smile, they never speakBut pretend to be your friendThen strike you down Sweet revenge, hatred deepSay a prayer, then watch you weepStrong, the mighty, one and allEach one will fall Too late, the chase has begunMy every move, they're right behind meIt's never fate, when damage is doneTo the bitter sweet end'Til the battle is won I'm standing tall...Freedom and justice have gone, they stripped it from meI'll take 'em all...The courage to fight everyone'Til truth prevails
Ignored and hated by many, he can't stand the very sight of himself.Believing only that people wish him harm,While all the time there is a sympathetic eye from an admiring lady.As the years pass, she slowly gains his trust,But not without incident.Being of a passive and loving nature,She helps to transform his anger with regression.Eventually his fears are changed into a positive beliefIn the goodness we all possess.Ignored by the many, adored by the chosen fewFriends he hasn't any, just his own point of viewThere stands a lady in between the shadowsWaiting patiently for youHolding out her hand she whispersTogether we'll pull throughShe transforms his angerHelps him wipe away the tearsI'll be there, standing next to youI'll be there I will pray, I will pray for you'Cause you're one of the forgotten childrenOne of the, one of those forgotten childrenOne of the forgotten friendsCast away those sins forgivenFight on, fight on to the endYou've gotta fight on
An' through the mist I see, an image standing thereBut do my eyes deceive meI'm seeing what I see, what is realityIt's just a gameThe great charade, which we playAre we here, to pick out the cluesOpposites they always meet... try to focus try to seeNothing here is what it seems.. in this world, nothing's realTry to focus try to see... where opposites always meetNothing in this world is real... nothing here is what it seemsA concept so surreal, this abstract world in viewWith no beginning or endingOur rationality, we think therefore we areIf it's a game, who makes the rulesAn' now the mist has cleared, thyn eyes the truth they seeBeneath the mysteries, the magicOur future is in our hands, if we are who we areThe choice is ours, if we choose

No-longer can he smile, norWill his conscience give him the freedom to lie or cheat. Exhausted, weakAnd weary, he can't bear to face her. Passing a backstreet bar, he'sEasily enticed inside, while a stranger sensing his vulnerabilty, helps toAlleviate him from the responsibilty for the couple's last savings. DumpedIn a drunken heap, and the stranger nowhere to be found, the fatherStruggles to his feet, as the alcohol suppresses his will to fight.Momentarily he sees a way out. A vantage point high on an empty bridge,Peacefully he falls to his death. Frightened of exposing her identity, sheGives birth in a darkenend backroom. The innocent child free of pride orPrejudice, begins it's long journey discovering life's wonders, andTragically life's many weaknesses.

I can't imagine any other way than simply saying why I really feel this wayIt's mystifying in each and every sense so nothing ventured nothing new to gainSlowly life keeps moving on before you know it's goneThe chance to say what's on your mindMy lips are drying up because of guiltNo point in crying once the blood is spiltNo good denying what is wrong or rightTime has a way of healing everything in sightDon't forsake the broken hearted wishful thoughts and proud idealsFinish what you've already started and one day you'll blessed with thePower to reach the ones you trustWho ever listens every word in vain family connections goes against the grainTakes some persuasion trying to break through advice worth delayingWhen starting over new

In a dangerous environment, a single mother fights against tradition.Protecting her son from the corrupt influences surrounding them both.She tries to raise him as a good and honest person. Year after year, many sacrifices have to be made, but the white lies and tales she tells each Christmas, 'Cause the child to develop a warped perception of life.Danger lurks in every place A mother fights to protect her child Tradition stipulates its way It's easy for them to say Influences all around Hard to change, creatures of habit Sacrifices must be made A few white lies she must tell[Bridge] The pressure lay on her shoulders Decisions unfair Desperately seeking comfort Searching for strength not there[Chorus] Have no fear Unorthodox ways, unorthodox methods Alone and afraid, different from others All alone She carries the strain, the future uncovers Hide your tearsYears of hardship and of pain Corruption lingers in all the dark corners Her efforts are in vain His perception of life has changed Don't waste your time He's lost, it's time to pray[Bridge] Stupid to point a finger, she isn't to blame Believing that life will bring him strength The courage to find his way[Chorus]
Sadly his mother watches helplessly, as her child demolishes the very fabric she believes in. Catching an occasional glimpse, she remembers with great pain, the anguish she felt, as the memories from her past re-appear. Frustration turns to confused anger. She still can't come to terms with the fact that her husband took his own life. "Why", she asks herself, "why didn't he tell me? Why couldn't anybody lend him a helping hand?" All the while her son is silently crying out for help.[Intro]Looking back in time, Without consent. two lovers ran away A tragic tale, so often made So sad and destined to fail[Verse]They're in and out of every place Searchin' hard a sad disgrace At best a darkened room, without a view Those memories, still remain Never once did she complain Now time repeats itself, all over again[Bridge]What he did, was insane Sadly his own life he'd take And you've been left to face the guilt, alone[Chorus]Just try to remember He was a victim of circumstance Close your eyes, try to recall The strength you felt Now, is the time to be stronger Than you've ever been before Bury all your anguish and fear, you're not to blame[Verse]Don't analyze, come to terms Face the truth, don't turn away Where there's a will, there has to be a way Into the world, your child came Responsibility or shame He backed away from you, don't lose him again[Ad-libs]You're not alone! you've got to be stronger 
Conceptual imaginary, it seems so real which world do you live inI sense the emptiness inside the brain no apparent function, it has no nameNor does it see reality an existence in an endless masqueradePeople adopt peculiar ways interpretation caught in the mazeInstinct the essence of life somehow changed effecting the insideMy life is a world in a visual vortexWhere reality and thought drift through timeI'm a million miles from anywhere a solitary isolation bareWhere fantasies are real as can be a world within a world no sense of realityMy life is a world in a visual vortex where reality and thoughtGo spinning through time a parallax world in a visual vortexCaught between the emptiness of time
I lay alone, wrapped in chains and lost in visionsSearching for reasons why I feel the pain of the worldTo my dismay the visions increased, the rage grew strongerI'm burning the food of the ones who are skin to the boneWho are you, projecting my crimes and dealing in painI need to goIn vision two, a blood red sky, well known intentionsI'm carving a name in the bullet, it gives me the eyeHe's so alone, desperate he walks the streets of ashes,Removing the bricks from the ruins as he screamed for his girlWhere are you, projecting the grief,A world gone insaneI need to go[Chorus]Under in body and soul,Take me under in a sea of loveHiding behind the windows of the worldUnder under your wings,Take me under and fly me awayThunder, out the windows of the worldShe's daddy's girl, he loves her so, he'd like to touch herShows her the nature of men, it's the way of the worldA winters night, the writing stopped, the words are written"Show me the freedom" she cries as she picks up the gunWho are you, projecting the grief, a world gone insaneI need to go[Chorus]
