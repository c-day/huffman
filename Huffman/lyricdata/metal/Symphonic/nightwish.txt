The wolves, my love, will comeTaking us home where dust once was a manIs there life before a death?Do we long too much?(And never let in)[Chorus]Howl! Seven days to the wolvesWhere will we be when they come?Seven days to the poisonAnd a place in heavenTime drawing near usThey come to take usThis is my church of choiceLast drinks and death in last sacrificeFor the rest, I have to say to youI will dream like the god(And suffer like all the dead children)[Chorus]This is where heroes and cowards part waysLight the fire, feastChase the ghosts, give inTake the road less traveled byLeave the city of foolsTurn every poet loose[Chorus: x2]HeroCowardNo more
Lay your head down And sleep on my shoulder Lay your head down And start a new dream  And for tonight the moment is over Drift in a lullaby Here where the stars reside And angels are always seen  Lay your head down The stars they have whispered Hear what they say And know that it means  The moon is your guide The stars they have kissed her As she goes gently by Light as a baby's eye Safe on a fairytale stream  And start a new dream
A star falls down from the darkened skyWhere new worlds born and dieKingdom Animalia watches its approaching glowWhat it means is soon to be knownBeneath the lovely birch honeymakers build their nest in peaceOn the savannah a lion licks a wounded gnuTo honor this moment even the heavens ceaseGiant spiders learn how to swimWith whales they form a united kinSnakes say hello to the rats on the groundIn the meadows play merrily the fox and the houndTrilobite & AnymalocharisThe prey and the hunterSurvival of the fittestFall of ManSeadrops foam all empty human skullsThose on the shores of AtlantisDarwin's resurrection is witnessedBy turtles he used to play withHealed and happy She overseesThe MotherThe tyrant's return to the sea

Norsemen hearts belong to youAncient God of warYou have created a sacred worldIn ASGARD is your throneTime has come to praise the GodCrazy beings were living hereIn superstitious fearAngry Gods would ever causePestilence or warTime has come to praise it has comeDo it over and over againPraise him for the upcoming warYou won't feel astrayHe's got power in his handSo cry aloud his nameODIN used to overlookFrom the exalted throneGazed towards south and westThe goal of all the hopesTime has come to praise it has comeDo it over and over againPraise him for the upcoming warYou won't feel astrayHe's got power in his handSo cry aloud his name Asgard protects the warriorsAsgard shelter of Gods Evil grew among the GodsHoly Sagrad faultNoone praise it started nowThe twilight of the GodsTime has come to praise it has comeDo it over and over againPraise him for the upcoming warYou won't feel astrayHe's got power in his handSo cry aloud his name Asgard protects the warriorsAsgard shelter of Gods

Sweet boy, come in I am the dark side of you Die for my sins Like the One once did Cinnamon bed For your unashamed appetite A figurante This dance will hurt like hell Oh, bare grace misery Just a child without a fairytale am I Dark but so lovely A Little Match Girl freezing in the snow Love lying, enticing (Bare grace misery) Crowning the moment (Bare grace misery) This is what I am Bare grace for the end of days Romantic scent Spoiled Lucrece lies warm for you There's no such priest That can pray me to heaven When done with me Forget if you think I feel ashamed A wild thing Never felt sorry for anything Love lying...

I was born amidst the purple waterfalls.I was weak, yet not unblessed.Dead to the world. Alive for the journey.One night I dreamt a white rose withering,a newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness.I dreamt all my future. Relived my past.I witnessed the beauty of the beast.Where have all the feelings gone?Why has all the laughter ceased?Why am I loved only when I'm gone?Gone back in time to bless the childThink of me long enough to make a memoryCome bless the child one more timeHow can I ever feel again?Given the chance would I return?I've never felt so alone in my lifeAs I drank from a cup which was counting my timeThere's a poison drop in this cup of ManTo drink it is to follow the left hand pathWhere have all the feelings gone?Why is the deadliest sin -to love as I loved you?Now unblessed, homesick in time,soon to be freed from care, from human pain.My tale is the most bitter truth:Time pays us but with earth & dustand a dark, silent grave.Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron,hope is only an illusion and the Ocean Soul'snothing but a name...The Child bless thee and keep thee forever.

Finally the hills are without eyesThey are tired of painting a dead man`s face redWith their own bloodThey used to love having so much to loseBlink your eyes just once and see everything in ruinsDid you ever hear what I told youDid you ever read what I wrote youDid you ever listen to what we playedDid you ever let in what the world saidDid we get this far just to feel your hateDid we play to become only pawns in the gameHow blind can you be, don`t you seeYou chose the long road but we`ll be waitingBye bye beautifulJacob`s ghost for the girl in whiteBlindfold for the blindDead siblings walking the dying earthNoose around a choking heartEternity torn apartSlow toll now the funeral bellsI need to die to feel alive?Did you ever hear what I told youDid you ever read what I wrote youDid you ever listen to what we playedDid you ever let in what the world saidDid we get this far just to feel your hateDid we play to become only pawns in the gameHow blind can you be, don`t you seeYou chose the long road but we`ll be waitingBye bye beautifulIt`s not the tree that forsakes the flowerBut the flower that forsakes the treeSomeday I`ll learn to love these scarsStill fresh from the red-hot blade of your wordsHow blind can you be, don`t you seeThat the gambler lost all he does not haveDid you ever hear what I told youDid you ever read what I wrote youDid you ever listen to what we playedDid you ever let in what the world saidDid we get this far just to feel your hateDid we play to become only pawns in the gameHow blind can you be, don`t you seeYou chose the long road but we`ll be waitingBye bye beautiful
Running for her lifeThe dark rain from her eyes still fallsBreathtaking butterflyChose a dark day to liveSave one breath for meA Loner longing forThe cadence of her last breathWhy do I miss someoneI never met, with bated breath I laySeawinds brought her to meA butterfly, mere one-day miracle of lifeAnd all the poetry in the worldFinally makes sense to meSave one death for meA Loner longing forThe cadence of her last breathPut to rest all that`s not lifeDrink for beauty and fill my blank pageSometimes a dream turns into a dreamA Loner longing forThe cadence of her last breath
Come wet a widow's eye Cover the night with your love Dry the rain from my beaten face Drink the wine the red sweet taste of mine Come cover me with you For the thrill Till you will take me in Come comfort me in you Young love must Live twice only for us For me For you Time devours passion's beauty With me With you In war for the love of you For me For you Time devours passion's beauty With me With you Tonight any dream will doNot a world but your fine grace Seduction in sleepwalker's land November dressed in May on your face Holding us now the lovecropper's hand Come cover me with you Come cover Come cover me nowCome cover me with you For the thrill Till you will take me in Come comfort me in you Young love must Live twice only for us Come cover me with you Come cover Come cover me now
Soon I will be here no more You'll hear my tale Through my blood Through my people And the eagle's cry The bear within will never lay to rest Wandering on Horizon Road Following the trail of tears White man came Saw the blessed land We cared, you took You fought, we lost Not the war but an unfair fight Sceneries painted beautiful in blood Wandering on Horizon Road Following the trail of tears Once we were here Where we have lived since the world began Since time itself gave us this land Our souls will join again the wild Our home in peace 'n war 'n death Wandering on Horizon Road... " I still dream every night Of them wolves, them mustangs, those endless prairies The restless winds over mountaintops The unspoilt frontier of my kith n'kin The hallowed land of the Great Spirit I still believe In every night In every day I am like the caribou And you like the wolves that make me stronger We never owed you anything Our only debt is one life for our Mother It was a good day to chant this song For Her Our spirit was here long before you Long before us And long will it be after your pride brings you to your end "

Crownless again shall be the queen Trophy on her grave still remains unseen A boat on the river confessing the sins The Riddler revealing the deep hidden things Crownless again shall be the king A gull covered in oil with a broken wing A hitcher on a road alone and lost Iron sharpens iron - a truth that once was Mine is the Earth and the sword in the stone Mine is the throne for the idol One fleeting moment and it is all gone Crownless again Will I fall? Roaming on razor-sharp castles Ruling all but myself (Now my night is laid to sleep) One fragrant rose worth ten times what I am A crippled begging a coin braver than I ever was Reflection from me, Devil dressed in white Chasten the being Become what I once was Mine is the Earth
Once I had a dreamAnd this is itOnce there was a child's dreamOne night the clock struck twelveThe window open wideOnce there was a child's heartThe age I learned to flyAnd took a step outsideOnce I knew all the talesIt's time to turn back timeFollow the pale moonlightOnce I wished for this nightFaith brought me hereIt's time to cut the rope and flyFly to a dreamFar across the seaAll the burdens goneOpen the chest once moreDark chest of wondersSeen through the eyesOf the one with pure heartOnce so long agoThe one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from meThis night will bring him back to meFly to a dream
Born from silence, silence full of itA perfect concert my best friendSo much to live for, so much to die forIf only my heart had a homeSing what you can't sayForget what you can't playHasten to drown into beautiful eyesWalk within my poetry, this dying musicMy love letter to nobodyNever sigh for better worldIt's already composed, played and toldEvery thought the music I writeEverything a wish for the nightWrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virginDied for the beauty the one in the gardenCreated a kingdom, reached for the wisdomFailed in becoming a godNever sigh"If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote itRemember only the verse, songmaker's cry, the one without tearsFor I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortalityWhere being wanted became a thrill I never knewThe sweet piano writing down my life""Teach me passion for I fear it's goneShow me love, hold the lornSo much more I wanted to give to the ones who love meI'm sorryTime will tell (this bitter farewell)I live no more to shame nor me nor youAnd you, I wish I didn't feel for you anymore"A lonely soul, an ocean soul
The story behind the paintingI drew is already toldNo more tear stains on the pages of my diaryTired by unable to give up since I'mResponsible for the lives I savedThe play is doneThe curtain's downAll the tales are toldAll the orchids goneLost in my own worldNow I care for dead gardensMy song is little worth anymoreTime to lay this weary pen asideThe play is doneThe curtain's down"Where are the wolves, the underwater moonThe eleventh, the haven of youthLagoons of the starlit seaHave I felt enough for one man's deed?Or is it time to challenge the Ancient of DaysAnd let the virgin conceive"All the tales
All the same take me awayWe're dead to the worldThe child gave thought to the poet's worldGave comfort to the fallen(heartfelt, lovelorn)Remaining, yet still uninvitedThose words scented my soul(lonely soul, ocean soul)It's not the monsters under your bedIt is the man next doorThat makes you fear, makes you cry,Makes you cry for the childAll the wars are fought among those lonely menUnarmed, unscarredI don't want to die a scarless manA lonely soul(tell me now what to do)I studied silence to learn the musicI joined the sinful to regain innocenceHeaven queen, cover meIn all that blueLittle boy, such precious joyIs dead to the worldHeaven queen, carry meAway from all painAll the same take me awayWe're dead to the worldDead, silent, constantYet always changing- my favorite view of this worldAs he died, he will return to die in me againWeaving the cloth,Giving birth to the century childWho gave his life not for the worldBut for me innocence reborn once more
In your creation heaven did decree That in your arms sweet death should dwell Deep Silent Complete Black velvet sea The sirens are calling for me Saved my soul thinking "This song's a lie" Sand on the shore is so dry Deep Silent Complete Black velvet sea Brave day sinking in endless night The age will say "This poet lies" Heaven never touched earthly face The age will say "This night was ours" Blessed with the Deep The Silent the Complete
A snowy owl above the haunted watersPoet of ancient godsCries to tell the neverending storyProphecy of becoming floodsAn aura of mystery surrounds herThe lady in brightest whiteSoon the incarnate shall be bornThe Creator of the NightDeep dark is His Majesty's kingdomA portent of tomorrow's worldThere shall the liquid give Him powerThe red-eyed unborn lordFatal embrace of the bloodred watersThe cradle of infinite gloomThe spell to master this EarthCarven on an infant's tomb"I will die for the love of the mermaidHer seduction beauty and scornWelcome to the end of your life- Hail the Oceanborn!""Disgraced is my virginityDeath has woven my wedding dressOh Great Blue breathe the morning dewFor you are the cradle of the image of god""Brave now long rest is sweetWith me here in the deep""I prayed for pleasure wished for lovePrayed for your - ""Never pray for me!""Who the hell are you for meBut a mortal dream to see?""This apathetic life must drownForever just for me""Leave me beLeave me beLeave me be...ee...eeee""From cradle to coffinShall my wickedness be your passion"We shall come to set the dolphins freeWe shall wash the darkened bloodred seaOur songs will echo over the mountains and seasThe eternity will begin once again in peace

Fare thee well, little broken heartDowncast eyes, lifetime lonelinessWhatever walks in my heart will walk aloneConstant longing for the perfect soulUnwashed scenery forever goneWhatever walks in my heart will walk aloneNo love left in meNo eyes to see the heaven beside meMy time is yet to comeSo I'll be forever yoursWhatever walks in my heart will walk aloneNo love left in meNo eyes to see the heaven beside meMy time is yet to comeSo I'll be forever yoursNo love left in meNo eyes to see the heaven beside meMy time is yet to comeSo I'll be forever yoursWhatever walks in my heart will walk alone
Toll no bell for me fatherBut let this cup of suffering pass from meSend me no shepherd to heal my worldBut the angel, the dream foretoldPrayed more than thrice for you to seeThe wolf of loneliness in meNot my own will but yours be doneYou wake up where's the tomb?Will easter come, enter my room?The lord weeps with meBut my tears fall for youAnother beautyLoved by a beastAnother tale of infinite dreamsYour eyes they were my paradiseYour smile made my sun riseForgive me for I don't know what I gainAlone in this garden of painEnchantment has but one truth:I weep to have what I fear to loseYou wake up where's the tomb?Will easter come, enter my room?The lord weeps with meBut my tears fall for you"I knew you never beforeI see you never moreBut the love the pain the hope o beautiful oneHave made you mine 'till all my years are done"Without youThe poetry within me is dead

We used to swim the same moonlight watersOceans away from the wakeful dayMy fall will be for you My fall will be for youMy love will be in youIf you be the one to cut meI'll bleed foreverScent of the sea before waking afterwardsBrings me to theeInto the blue memoryMy fall will be for you Into the blue memoryA siren from the deep came to meSang my name my longingStill I write my songs about that dream of mineWorth everything I may ever beThe Child will be born againThat siren carried him to meFirst of them true loversSinging on the shoulders of an angelWithout care for love n' lossBring me home or leave me beMy love in the dark heart of the nightI have lost the path before methe one behind will lead meTake meCure meKill meBring me homeEvery wayEvery dayJust another loop in the hangman's nooseTake me, cure me, kill me, bring me homeEvery way, every dayI keep on watching us sleepRelive the old sin ofAdam and EveOf you and meForgive the adoring beastRedeem me into childhoodShow me myself without the shellLike the advent of MayI'll be there when you sayTime to never hold our loveMy fall will be for you

[Pink Floyd cover] Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young.In a world of magnets and miraclesOur thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary,The ringing of the division bell had begun. Along the Long Road and on down to the causeway,Do they still meet there by the Cut There was a ragged band that followed in our footstepsRunning before time took our dreams awayLeaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground,To a life consumed by slow decay. The grass was greenerThe light was brighterWith friends surroundingThe nights of wonder Looking beyond the embers of the bridges glowing behind usTo a glimpse at our great lose of the other sideSteps taken forward but sleepwalking back again,Dragged by force of some inner tide But the highest altitude with flag unfurledWe reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world Encumbered forever by desire and ambition,There's hunger still unsatisfied,Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon,Though down this road we've been so many times. The grass was greenerThe light was brighterThe taste was sweeterThe nights of wonderWith friends surroundedThe dark mist growingThe water flowingThe endless riverForever and ever [x2]

Time it took the most of meAnd left me with no keyTo unlock the chest of remedyMother, the pain ain't hurting meBut the love that I feelWhen you hold me nearThe hopes were highThe choirs were vastNow my dreams are left to live through youRed Sun risingDrown without inhalingWithin, the dark holds hardRed Sun risingCurtain fallingHigher than hope my cure liesPassion tideAn angel by my sideBut no Christ to end this warTo deliver my soul from the swordHope has show me a sceneryParadise poetryWith first snow I'll be goneThe hopes were highRed Sun risingYour death saved meRed Sun rising
The treetops, the chimneys, the snowbed stories, winter greyWildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheatA railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly loveBlue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wingsWhere is the wonder where's the aweWhere's dear Alice knocking on the doorWhere's the trapdoor that takes me thereWhere's the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh HareWhere is the wonder where's the aweWhere are the sleepless nights I used to live forBefore the years take meI wish to seeThe lost in meI want my tears backI want my tears back nowA ballet on a grove, still growing young all aloneA rag doll, a best friend, the voice of Mary Costa

For whom the gun tolls For whom the prey weeps Bow before a war Call it religion Some wounds never heal Some tears never will Dry for the unkind Cry for mankind Even the dead cry - Their only comfort Kill your friend, I don`t care Orchid kids, blinded stare Need to understand No need to forgive No truth no sense left to be followed
What does the free fall feel like?Asks the boy with a spark in his eyeKnow why the nightingale sings?Is the answer to everythingTaking a step to a world unboundSpinning my fantasies all aroundFreed from the gravital leashI swear the heaven's in my reachDancing with the spirit of the airIn this ocean so open and fairMaking love to the gods aboveOn my maiden voyage so boldLanding safely to the blue lagoonDon't know if this is the earth or the moonJoy of living is no more a maskThe Eden I found will forever lastMigrating with the geeseMy soul has finally found peaceDoesn't matter that man has no wingsAs long as I hear the nightingale sing...

We live in every moment but this oneWhy don't we recognize the faces loving us soWhat's God if not the spark that started my lifeSmile of a strangerSweet music, starry skiesWonder, mystery wherever my road goesEarly wake-ups in a moving homeScent of fresh-mown grass in the morning-sunOpen theme park gates waiting forRiding the day, every day into sunsetFinding the way back homeOnce upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of lifeThe beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible highIt's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark insteadThis moment the dawn of humanityThe last ride of the dayWake up, Dead BoyEnter adventurelandTricksters, magicians will show you all that's realCareless jugglers, snake charmers by your trailMagic of a momentAbracadabra
A single grain can tip the scaleAmidst the burden, the scale will prevailShowing what's worth being hereStoryteller by a hearth of stoneA white little creature purring meMy childhood kingdom gone in timeThe islands filling my mind with blueThe one in special, heaven?s courtAll the joy unforgiven by this taskAn errant soul, homeless and foulAll gone but the will to live to tell the taleThe days are filled with anxietyFrustration, one right note a dayWhere to find a perfect tuneJust do the work and take a step backAll the joy unforgiven by this taskAn errant soul, homeless and foulAll gone but the will to live to tell the taleDark chambers of my mindLocked around the neck of my loveNone of you understand and it doesn't matterTo a broken marionette like me(Me)An errant soul, homeless and foulAn errant soul, homeless and foulAll gone but the will to live to tell the, to tell the tale
Trees have dropped their leaves,Clouds their watersAll this burden is killing meDistance is covering your way,Tears your memoryAll this beauty is killing meOh, do you care,I still feel for youSo aware,What should be lost is thereI fear I will never find anyoneI know my greatest pain is yet to comeWill we find each other in the darkMy long lost love
Who the hell are you to tell meWhat to do, why to do, why botherLeech in a mask of virtueSuch waste, to ever think of you againHey Judas, your Christess was our loveHit and run, your will be doneNever sorry, never wrongMore more more more moreMaster passion greed?Hello. How are you?Let me explain one thing.All for her and more for meWhy is it so hard to see?I see no sense in doing thisNot enough for meI fuck up everything but let me explain.?Some day you shall flee,Panting and weakMaster passion greedAll within me gone but pain and hopeHoping that the pain would fade awayGreed, your master passionI Feed the mouth that bites meMammon, opiate of the massesThe reek of your lies draws fliesSeek herSeduce herTame herBlame herHave herKill herFeast on it allWith awakening the tears will beginTo my everlasting shame silence took me
I close my eyes, the lantern diesThe scent of awakening, wild honey and dewChildhood games, woods and lakesStreams of silver, toys of olden daysMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenLands of wonder and of hidden treasuresIn the meadow of life, my acre of HeavenA five-year-old winter heart in a place called homeSailing the waves of pastMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenRocking chair without a dreamerA wood and a spring without laughter?Sandbox without toy soldiersYuletide without the flightDream down for herFlowers wither, treasures stay hiddenUntil I see the first star-fallI fall asleep and see it allMother care and colour of the kitesMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenMeadows of HeavenMeadows of Heaven

Oh, setting Sun,Thy red rays maketh me cry.They remind me of the oneWhose love awaits me in the sky. A bridal bed awaits us bothAfter the landscape of death I cross.Before my sorrows I must die,Nightwish I send through the starlit sky. The voice of nightly winds has awakened me,Amidst all the grief they embrace me with relief.Beneath my dreams and wishesI long for thy caresses. A bridal bed awaits us both,After the landscape of death I cross.Before my sorrows I must die,Nightwish I send through the starlit sky. "Passed away in silenceThe flute from the realm unseenEmpties it's heartMaking love to meWith it's enchanting melody.Light of Orion,Shadow of Andromeda,Call of the dancing Universe.Their love I must enterBefore thou can blame my soulThat is peace"
The scent of a woman was not mineWelcome home, darlingDid you miss me?Wish to dwell in dear love?Touch my milk-like skinFeel the oceanLick my deepestHear the starry choirRip off this laceThat keeps me imprisonedBut beware the enchantmentFor my eroticism is your oblivionOld love lies deep, you saidDeeper shall be the wound between your legs
One more nightTo bear this nightmareWhat more do I have to sayCrying for me was never worth a tearMy lonely soul is only filled with fearLong hours of lonelinessBetween me and the seaLosing emotionFinding devotionShould I dress in white and search the seaAs I always wished to be - one with the wavesOcean SoulWalking the tide lineI hear your nameIs angels whisperingSomething so beautiful it hurtsLong hours of lonelinessBetween me and the seaI only wished to become something beautifulThrough my music, through my silent devotionLosing emotionFinding devotionShould I dress in white and search the seaAs I always wished to be one with the wavesOcean Soul
A lonely bard wandering across the lands am ISinging dancing finding answers to every whyThe taverns are full and one crosses my path, tooI just might reward myself with a beer or two This inn the place of many romantic talesOn the loft women offer their salesBut my eyes they catch a girl beat by everyoneA slave she is but for me a rose undone Hear me singWatch me dancePlay that lute of thineAnd share with me this dance As she danced my eyes began to shineThere she was the maiden so divineHow could I approach her with my outlook so poorHer beauty being much more than I could endure So I asked if I could sing a chansonWith a language of ancient and of loreGathered the men around us me and the girl in ragsSoon were the melodies heard by everyone Hear us singWatch us danceSing with us this taleWith a clap of hands The stories long-forgotten we still knowPerforming our skills wherever we goI end my story as I receive a kissFrom my girl the dearest Beatrice Hear us singWatch us danceSing with us the talesWhich the music will keep alive

The nightingale is still locked in the cageThe deep breath I took still poisons my lungsAn old oak sheltering me from the blueSun bathing on its dead frozen leavesA catnap in the ghost town of my heartShe dreams of storytime and the river ghostsOf mermaids, of Whitman's and the rideRaving harlequins, gigantic toysA song of me song in needOf a courageous symphonyA verse of me verse in needOf a pure-heart singing me to peaceAll that great heart lying still and slowly dyingAll that great heart lying still on an angelwingAll that great heart lying stillIn silent sufferingSmiling like a clown until the show has come to an endWhat is left for encoreIs the same old dead boy's songSung in silenceAll that great heart lying still and slowly dyingAll that great heart lying still on an angelwingA midnight flight into Covington WoodsA princess and a panther by my sideThese are Territories I live forI'd still give mt everything to love you moreA silent symphonyA hollow opus #1,2,3Sometimes the sky is piano blackPiano black over cleansing watersResting pipes, verse of boreRusting keys without a doorSometimes the within is piano blackPiano black over cleansing watersAll that great heart lying still and slowly dyingAll that great heart lying still on an angelwingI see a slow, simple youngster by a busy street,With a begging bowl in his shaking hand.Trying to smile but hurting infinitely. Nobody notices.I do, but walk by.An old man gets naked and kisses a model-doll in his atticIt's half-light and he's in tears.When he finally comes his eyes are cascading.I see a beaten dog in a pungent alley. He tries to bite me.All pride has left his wild eyes.I wish I had my leg to spare.A mother visits her son, smiles to him through the bars.She's never loved him more.An obese girl enters an elevator with me.All dressed up fancy, a green butterfly on her neck.Terribly sweeet perfume deafens me.She's going to dinner alone.That makes her even more beautiful.I see a model's face on a brick wall.A statue of porcelain perfection beside a violent city kill.A city that worships flesh.The 1st thing I ever heard was a wanderingMan telling his storyIt was you, the grass under my bare feetThe campfire in the dead of nightThe heavenly black of sky and seaIt was usRoaming the rainy roads, combing the guilded beachesWaking up to a new gallery of wonders every mornBathing in places no-one's seen beforeShipwrecked on some matt-painted islandClad in nothing but the surf - beauty's finest robeBeyond all mortality we are, swinging in the breath of natureIn early air of the dawn of lifeA sight to silence the heavensI want to travel where life travels,Following its permanent leadWhere the air tastes like snow musicWhere grass smells like fresh-born EdenI would pass no man, no stranger, no tragedy or raptureI would bathe in a world of sensationLove, goodness and simplicity(While violated and imprisoned by technology)The thought of my family's graves was the only momentI used to experience true loveThat love remains infintie,As I'll never be the man my father isHow can you "just be yourself"When you don't know who you are?Stop saying "I know how you feel"How could anyone know how another feels?Who am I to judge a priest, beggar,Whore, politician, wrongdoer?I am, you are, all of them alreadyDear child, stop working, go playForget every ruleThere's no fear in a dream"Is there a village inside this snowflake?"- a child asked me"What's the colour of our lullaby?"I've never been so close to truth as thenI touched its silver liningDeath is the winner in any warNothing noble in dying for your religionFor your countryFor ideology, for faithFor another man, yesPaper is dead without wordsInk idle without a poemAll the world dead without storiesWithout love and disarming beautyCareless realism costs soulsEver seen the Lord smile?Allt he care for the world made Beautiful a sad man?Why do we still carry a device of torture around our necks?Oh, how rotten your pre-apocalypse isAll you bible-black fools living over nightmare groundI see all those empty cradles and wonderIf man will never changeI, too, wish to be a decent manboy but all I amIs smoke and mirrorsStill given everything, may I be deservingAnd there forever remains the change from G to Em

All those beautiful peopleI want to have them allAll those porcelain modelsIf only I could make them fallBe my heart a well of loveFlowing free so far aboveA wintry eveOnce upon a taleAn Ugly DucklingLost in a verseOf a sparrows carolDreaming the starsBe my heart a well of loveFlowing free so far aboveIn my worldLove is for poetsNever the famous balcony sceneJust a dying faithOn the heaven's gateCrystal pond awaits the lornTonight another morn for the lonely one is born

Today I killed, he was just a boyEight before him, I knew them allIn the fields a dying oathI'd kill them all to save my ownCut me free, bleed with me, oh noOne by one, we will fall, down, downPull the plug, end the pain, run'n fight for lifeHold on tight, this ain't my fightDeliver me from this warIt's not for me, it's because of youDevil's instant my eternityObey to kill to save yourselfCut me freeI envy the nine lives that gave me hellMy path made up by their torn bodiesMan to man, soldier to soldier, dust to dustCall me a coward but I can't take it anymoreThey wait for me back homeThe live with eyes turned awayThey were the first ones to seeThey are the last ones to bleedThe ultimate high as all beautiful diesA ruler's tool, priest's excuse, tyrant's delightI alone, the great white hunterI'll march till the dawn brings me rest10th patriot at the gallows' poleCut me free
Who are you? Man condemned to shine a salvationThroughout the centuriesWhy? Was the wine of the grailToo sour for man to drinkThe carpenterCarved his anchorOn the dying souls of mankindOn the tomb of this unknown soldierLay the tools of the one who for us had diedTools of the carpenterThe one they lickThe same old sickDream of their precious saviorKiss them deepAnd make them weepOver promises of eternal peaceThe carpenterCarved his anchorOn the dying souls of mankindOn the tomb of this unknown soldierLay the tools of the one who for us had diedTools of the carpenterI hear youThrough the symphonic voices of natureThe purity I could never doubtThey tell me to lie on the grassAnd observe my saviorThe one crucified to the chirping of birdsThe carpenterCarved his anchorOn the dying souls of mankindOn the tomb of this unknown soldierLay the tools of the one who for us had diedTools of the carpenter
Don't give me love, don't give me faith.Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty not rest, give me truth instead. A crow flew to me, kept its distance. Such a proud creation. I saw it's soul, envied it's pride. But needed nothing it had. An owl came to me, old and wise. Pierced right through my youth. I learned its ways, envied it's sense.But needed nothing it had.Don't give me love, don't give me faith.Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead.Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty not rest, give me truth instead. A dove came to me, had no fear. It rested on my arm. I touched its calm, envied its love.But needed nothing it had.A swan of white, she came to me. The lake mirrored her beauty sweet. I kissed her neck, adored her grace. But needed nothing she could give.Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.Got to grieve her, got to wreck it.Don't give me love, don't give me faith.Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty not rest, give me truth instead.Don't give me love, don't give me faith.Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty not rest, give me truth instead.Don't give me love, don't give me faith.Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead. Don't give me love, I've had my share. Beauty not rest, give me truth instead.
Who's there knocking at my window?The owl and the Dead BoyThis night whispers my nameAll the dying childrenVirgin snow beneath my feetPainting the world in whiteI tread the way and lose myself into a taleCome hell or high waterMy search will go onClayborn Voyage without an endA nightingale in a golden cageThat's me locked inside reality's mazeCome someone make my heavy heart lightCome undone, bring me back to lifeIt all starts with a lullabyJourney homeward boundA sound of a dolphin callingTearing off the mask of manThe tower, my sole guideThis is who I amEscapist, paradise seekerFarewell, now time to flyOut of sight, out of time, away from all liesA nightingale in a golden cageThat's me locked inside reality's mazeCome someone make my heavy heart lightCome undone, bring me back to lifeIt all starts with a lullaby
The ticktock of time allows me to seeAn owl turn to an echoThe butterfly to a cocoonA swan to ugly ducklingA lake to an ocean The dead times awakeAs I've been called myself to yesterdayThe flower has fallen it's petalsOut of the petals a cradle I will My cradle rocks with the waves of timeThe time of beauty will never be the sameOh, little girl, as thou must now leavePlease take me, take me with thee Now I hear my mother from the deepSing me a lullaby of eternal sleepWilt blow wee plant that last to recallAs in silence we sing to reborn
Silent night surrounding meOn the shore of wistful seaA kindest heart made me believeThe world as I wish it to be Wind in the wheatKiss by a hearthLittle hideaways for a lonely heart Cast away in beauty's gloomThe good in me, the child withinA cruelest heart made me forgetThe world as I wish it to be Home inside but lost for lifeHuman heart longing for loveSlave to the toil, this mortal coilThe strife, the suffering, the void Wind in the wheatKiss by a hearthA dead calm winter morn, Morning birds, and a smile of a stranger Frozen moments in timeLittle hideaways, the marrow of lifeLittle hideaways for a lonely heart Wind in the wheatKiss by a hearthLittle hideaways for a lonely heart Silent night surrounding meOn the shore of wistful seaA kindest heart made me believeThe world as I wish it to be.
An old man by a seashoreAt the end of dayGazes the horizonWith seawinds in his faceTempest-tossed islandSeasons all the sameAnchorage unpaintedAnd a ship without a nameSea without a shore for the banished one unheardHe lightens the beacon, light at the end of worldShowing the way lighting hope in their heartsThe ones on their travels homeward from afarThis is for long-forgottenLight at the end of the worldHorizon cryingThe tears he left behind long agoThe albatross is flyingMaking him daydreamThe time before he becameOne of the world`s unseenPrincess in the towerChildren in the fieldsLife gave him it all:An island of the universeNow his love`s a memoryA ghost in the fogHe sets the sails one last timeSaying farewell to the worldAnchor to the waterSeabed far belowGrass still in his feetAnd a smile beneath his browThis is for long-forgottenLight at the end of the worldHorizon cryingThe tears he left behind long agoSo long agoSo long agoThis is for long-forgottenLight at the end of the worldHorizon cryingThe tears he left behind so long agoSo long ago

I went into the wilderness with Uncle WaltI discovered the wildLearning to suck all the experienceSeeing the world through cradle's barsThe wild blessed me with an errant mindShowing the way for the ultimate loreI went around the world, beyond the wildFinding my home from an ocean shoreWayfarer, heart landerWhat if I only hadOne more night to liveHome is where the way isMy road goes on foreverOne more voyage to goDead to the worldAlive for the journey
Day posesses no key hereWhere moon sheds the cold twilightThis moment is eternity Land of beauty,Cold and cruelFjeld chants echoing,Reflecting the melancholy... Trust the windTrust the firesCall for the hermit of the night Land of raven and bearLand of eagle and wolverineDismal are the mirrors of a wolf

Sleep Eden sleepMy fallen sonSlumber in peaceCease the painLife's just in vainFor us to gainNothing but all the sameNo healing handFor your diseaseDrinking scorn like waterCascading with my tearsBeneath the candle bedTwo saddened angels, in heaven, in deathNow let us lieSad we lived sad we dieEven in your prideI never blamed youA mother's loveIs a sacrificeTogether sleepingKeeping it allNo sympathyNo eternityOne light for each undeserved tearBeneath the candle bedTwo souls with everything yet to be said
Lonely nights I think of youMy life, my king and my landLand of war will turn into lightDivine light will give us strength Sunlight divine cover my landAngels of light take care of us Still darkness surrounds myselfAmong the trees I saw the gates of hellI hear that someone screams my nameDevil claims for my life Sunlight divine give me the strengthAngels of light show me the way Flying up in the sky, riding through the windUntil dawn things won't change at allStrange sensations, fighting the evil in my heartAngels of light help me save my land Stars guide me in this nightLight my way to fight the darkGod, I pray to you one more timeWith your help I'll save my land Sunlight divine cover my landAngels of light take care of us Flying up in the sky, riding through the windUntil dawn things won't change at allStrange sensations, fighting the evil in my heartAngels of light help me save my land
We're walking in the airWe're floating in the moonlit skyThe people far below are sleeping as we flyI'm holding very tightI'm riding in the midnight blueI'm finding I can fly so high above with youFar across the woldThe villages go by like treesThe rivers and the hillsThe forests and the streamsChildren gaze open mouthTaken by surpriseNobody down below believes their eyesWe're surfing in the airWe're swimming in the frozen skyWe're drifting over icyMountains floating bySuddenly swooping low on an ocean deepArousing of a mighty monster from its sleepWe're walking in the airWe're floating in the midnight skyAnd everyone who sees us greets us as we fly

I want to see where the sirens singHear how the wolves howlSail the dead calm waters of the pacificDance in the fields of coralBe blinded by the whiteDiscover the deepest jungleI want to find the secret pathA bird delivered into my heart, soIt's not the endNot the kingdom comeIt is the journey that matters, the distant wandererCall of the wildIn me forever and ever and ever foreverWanderlustI want to love by the blue lagoonKiss under the waning moonStraying, claiming my place in this mortal coilRiding the dolphinsAsking the mountainsDreaming AlaskaThe earth can have but earthI want to findIt's not the endLook into my eyes and see the wandererSee the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder
StillSpinning 'round in my headHow I regret everything that I saidWhy did I tell you to go?Saving my pride but losing my soulI'm here all aloneStill wait by the phoneThe hours go byWhat else could I do but to cryI call, and I callJust to make things rightHave I lost the fight?Where were you last night?I beg, and I cryI keep asking whyWhere were you last night?Where were you last night?LostIn the dark and my fearsIf only you saw the tracks of my tearsI think I'm losing my mindWhere did you go, and what did you find?I'm here all aloneStill wait by the phoneThe hours go byWhat else could I do but to cry?I call, and I callJust to make things rightHave I lost the fight?Where were you last night?I beg, and I cryI keep asking whyWhere were you last night?Where were you last night?I call, and I callJust to make things rightHave I lost the fight?Where were you last night?I beg, and I cryI keep asking whyWhere were you last night?Where were you last night?I'm here all aloneStill wait by the phoneThe hours go byWhat else could I do but to cry?I call, and I callJust to make things rightHave I lost the fight?Where were you last night?I call, and I callJust to make things rightI call, and I callJust to make things rightHave I lost the fight?Where were you last night?I beg, and I cryI keep asking whyWhere were you last night?Where were you last night?Where were you last night?Where were you last night?I call, and I callJust to make things rightHave I lost the fight?Where were you last night?I beg, and I cryI keep asking whyWhere were you last night?Where were you last night?I call, and I callJust to make things rightHave I lost the fight?Where were you last night?
Sweet little words made for silence not talkYoung heart for love not heartacheDark hair for catching the windNot to veil the sight of a cold worldKiss while your lips are still redWhile he's still silentRest while bosom is still untouched, unveiledHold another hand while the hand's still without a toolDrown into eyes while they're still blindLove while the night still hides the withering dawnFirst day of love never comes backA passionate hour's never a wasted oneThe violin, the poet's handEvery thawing heart plays your theme with careKiss while your lips are still redWhile he's still silentRest while bosom is still untouched, unveiledHold another hand while the hand's still without a toolDrown into eyes while they're still blindLove while the night still hides the withering dawnKiss while your lips are still redWhile he's still silentRest while bosom is still untouched, unveiledHold another hand while the hand's still without a toolDrown into eyes while they're still blindLove while the night still hides the withering dawnLove while the night still hides the withering dawn
