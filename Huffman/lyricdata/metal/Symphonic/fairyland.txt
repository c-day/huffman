Death followed his path when first he cameThe coldness of his mind was that of steelDesease was his fortune, chaos his nameHis words disillusions, for blood he came The world was in terror, plague and chaos reignedBut in this darkness was a light In the name of innocence, in the name of holly lightFor the glory of the ancient gods, and for freedom weWill fight Eager for revenge,(the) traveller is backDefeated once before, but stronger nowThe fight may be harder, blood must be sharedBut hope is on our side, we'll fight again To save our kingdom, in the name of lightWe'll fight untill the end of time In the name of innocence, in the name of holly lightFor the glory of the ancient gods, and for freedom weWill fight Somewhere above, a kingdom in the cloudsThe wisdom of elders guide our swordsTogether as one, the light is on our sideThe holly fire burning in our hearts

The night was young for deliveranceThe path clear for allIn the darkes of thunder we follow the oneThe time when Cenos fooled all alikeThe dreams were bestowedFor the love of our pears we will sing and rejoice The night was young for deliveranceThe path clear for allIn the darkest of thunder we follow the oneThe time when Cenos fooled all alikeThe dreas were bestowed Bridge:The nightmare is over nowAngels will sing through endless times Chorus:Welcome the times when angels are coming tonightBefore my eyes, within my dreamsWelcome the timeWhen shadows are falling tonightTo reach the coast, freedom for allWe'll sail across the endless sea The night was young for deliveranceThe path clear for allIn the darkest of thunder we follow the oneThe time when Cenos fooled all alikeThe dreams were bestowedFor the love of our pears we will sing and rejoice [Bridge] [Chorus]

The gates of Morken lay in sight, this war is coming to an endBehind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from graceWitness the end of flowing tears, the final chapter of our dreamsThis lonely figure charges still, revenge fire within We are so close we feel their pain these brothers lost won't remain the sameOn wings outraging we must slain, win our freedom againWe came so close we feel their pain, we are so close they feel our return This is our time, our brothers were left behind, a silent and broken raceShall we prevail in fight, we'll turn the wrongs into rightsThe Angel will fall from grace Fire, burn in the dark winter sky, this madness will come to an endEndless bliss for the children of Light, the Giants will rise and defend Each fallen calls a thousand more, a frantic carnage with no endBehind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace Close your eyes, feel the dreams are fading: The Godsent supremacyClose your eyes, now the dreams are ending: Let's embrace our legacy The gates of Morken lay in sight, this war is coming to an endBehind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from graceWitness the end of flowing tears, the final chapter of our dreamsThis lonely figure charges still, revenge fire within We came so close we feel their pain, we are so close they feel our returnThis is our time, our brothers were left behind, a silent and broken raceShall we prevail in fight, we'll turn the wrongs into rightsThe Angel will fall from grace

At the end of their journeyOur children awakeWith the welcoming sight of a new day to comeA new kingdom of heaven, a future to makeNow the free men are finding their way home To the far horizon a new dawn awaitsFor a world united to cast the night awayAnd the winds are blowing all over the landWith a world now rejoicing to see another day On the far horizon a new dawn awaitsWhile the world rejoices to cast the night awayAnd the winds are blowing all over the landOn a world united to greet another day At the end of their journeyOur children awakeWith the welcoming sight of a new day to comeA new kingdom of heavens, a future to makeNow the free men are finding their way home On the far horizon a new dawn awaits"We were lost and now we rise"While the rejoices to cast the night away"Proudly stand"And the winds are blowing all over the land"And the winds are blowing again"On a world united to greet another day"Greeting another day"
Now I pledge alliegeanceTo my all mighty kingMy sword will serve thy majestyArmies of the dark, servants of hell preparing to failNo turning back, not even death could change my mind As the world will fall in war againAll of mankind will gather and fight (and fight again" The scream of revenge burns in my heartWe'll fight together and see another day again "Search for altars of gods around the world" he saidTo find them is the only wayAltars for the stones, guardians of hope created by godsUnited now to face the dark and evil throne The scream of revenge burns in my heartWe'll fight together and see another day again Carved in the stones lies my tribute to universeMy words speak in vain for a silent poetryHear me all mighty I ask for your wisdomYour path will be mine when I reach eternity Armies of the dark, servants of hell preparing to failNo turning back, not even death could change my mind Is that what I feel deep in my heartThe stones now scream and say mighty one fight for your king Mighty one fight for your king As the world will fall in war againAll of mankind will gather and fight The scream of revenge burns in my heartWe'll fight together and see another day again Carved in the stones lies my tribute to universeMy words speak in vain for a silent poetryHear me all mighty I ask for your wisdomYour path will be mine when I reach eternity
For so many years now I've longed to see my homeBut despite all I've done so far I walk my path aloneI've always tried to hide the tears, be strong and shake my fearsThey wanted me to guide them but fate was after me. Truly fate was after me "And we shall hunt the sun until it shines no more.Then all will fear my name for I am the true master of this world" I could have lived another way I'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my timeThe Gods of Heaven control my destinyI'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my timeI truly hope I am the one in charge of my destiny The dreams were meant to save and yet they seldom guaranteedThe issue wouldn't be lethal, the win so clearIn times of need and chaos a defender awaitsAnd so it had to be me, a hero out of hand.A hero out of hand "And we shall hunt the sun until it shines no more.Then all will fear my name for I am the true master of this world" I could have lived another way I'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my timeThe Gods of Heaven control my destinyI'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my timeI truly hope I am the one in charge of my destinyI'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my timeI truly hope I am the one in charge of my destiny

Climbing the moundsI can feel the pain inside meRiding alone searching forA reason to live The wave of destructionTook my soul away Force of the windFury never seen beforeThe sound of your laughtersRemain in my heart On the field the sky is burningTaking shades of a wintery nightI can see a thousand sparrowsDrawing a figure into the light I'll take my forceIn the darkness of your eyesAnd seal my fateBy the cold steel of my swordAnd before a long timeMy rage will be free Lost in the shadow was my heartMy mind was thorn in flamesAnd by the sacred magic stonesI'll see the light again On the field the sky is burningTaking shades of a wintery nightI can see a thousand sparrowsDrawing a figure into the light On the field the sky is burningTaking shades of a wintery night
In the shade of willows and elmsA cold wind blows and carries my taleA tale of rebirth, a season's changeAnd spring will shine again An early flower fragile and shyA ray of sun celebrates it's bloomThe gentle colors of winter's endThis poetry lights my heart For a thousand years to comeWill the flight of dragons fill the cloudsAnd the shine of spring will lighten againOn the king and on his land The leaves are dancing under the windThe songs of birds are filling my headA taste of heaven, a magic playThe return of better days The last trace of snow melts away (the last trace of snow will melt away)The dance of seasons is following it's courseThe circle of life closes againAnd spring prepares it's reign For a thousand years to comeWill the flight of dragons fill the cloudsAnd the shine of spring will lighten againOn the king and on his land For a thousand years to comeWill the flight of dragons fill the cloudsAnd the shine of spring will lighten againOn the king and on his land In this silence, the storm as gone away forever nowDeep in my heart, a shining spring will bloom here and explode
There is a place lost into spaceWhere live mystic legends mitsy talesOpen your mind to fantasyYou won't believe, won't believe what you will seeMagic and evil innoncence and liesThe wrong and the right and all that stands behind What do i seeWithin my dreamDeep in the corridor of time We ride awaySorrow brings tears to my heavenThen goes far awaySorrow brings tears to my heavenAnd then goes far away Now that we are riding, riding with the sunTo the land of the miraclesTo the land of the free Now that you've seen dragons in dreamBe aware for the legend beginsRide with the sun across the seasonsMarch with the light as father and sonAnd as the spirit of five thousand menThe strenght in your heart will burn like a flame. What do i seeWithin my dream We ride awaySorrow brings tears to my heavenThen goes far awaySorrow brings tears to my heavenAnd then goes far away Sorrow brings tears to my heavenAnd then goes far away
