You feel that all hope has goneThere's nothing more to looseYou see that the world falls apartAnd every day is the same No more feeling sadnessNo more hurting painNo more tears like rainNo more people dyingNo more endless fightingNo more emptiness There's a hero in all of usOne who will fight for allNo more darkness will blind usOnce again we'll be freeA hero in all When all the passion has gone awayAnd you are feeling aloneRemember there is always someone out thereThat feels the same as you do
I'm the ice manI am the assassin, I'm just a killer that kills for fun He had a though childhoodHe never knew loveShould we forgive him? Feel sorry for him? No!  Awaken The MonsterIt never ever sleepsIt's waiting for the next victimThe hunger never stops I kill for no reasonLook at me the wrong wayAnd you will die a slow and painful death
A fire is burning in the nightThe stars are shining so brightIt's always a silence before the stormBut when hell breaks loose the rage is born Listen to the voices inside youThey will guide you and show you the way We are far away from homeWe come from beyond the sunWe fight for freedom my friendAnd we'll stand by you until the end A warrior is razing his swordScreaming I will die for my lordThe sound of steel and metal is so loudRaise your head look ahead and be proud Be thy cross my victory, let me live for eternity Requiem, Aternaem. Dona Eis DomineDans La Glorie, De Ton Ciel(Almighty god, give us eternal rest, be thy cross my victory) Time is changing world is burningClock is ticking still we're not learningWorld is dying people are cryingHave we all just gone insane?
[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]No more time to wasteLet's fly into spaceCrossing the universeI can see the star lightWith the speed of lightWe will fly tonightLooking for unknown landsThe future is out there somewhereWe fly so high across the skyA million light years away I hear you cryLet the journey beginFly away with the windSpread your wingsLeave your worries behindAll that you see is realitySo welcome to the cyber futureTime is running outFaith is all we've gotIf we find this placeWe can save the human raceOne more mile to goThen we'll know for sureIf the end has come for usOr we will get our victoryA fire is burning in the skyIs this the end of you and I ?Take my hand and let us prayThat we survive one more dayI have read it in the sandThe prophecy is in your handThe cyber world is coming fastI wonder how long we will last ?Cyber, Cyber future, so little time to undo this crime
So what we've feared has begunIt's the end of the world this is the endNow they will cry out in fearThe metal machines are taking control Save us, save usWe don't want to dieFear them, see themFalling from the skies It's a cyber world and it's out of controlThere is no more places to hideWe created them to serve and protectBut now we all will die, Ooh ho hooCyborgs from hell They are human machinesMetal and flesh combined into oneA brain from a human was triedWhat a mistake, now we will die There will be no one aliveOne by one we all shall die
No more illusions, break down the wallsHere comes the truth, crushing at your ballsOh oh ooh, oh oh ooh we're heading for a fall So many signs, so many warningsYou tried to let us know, we didn't want to see itOh oh ooh, oh oh ooh we're heading for a fall Damnation, the mankind will fallDamnation, we have doomed us allDamnation, there's no returnDamnation, It has come to watch us burn The world is getting warmer, the climate is changingPollution of the sky, is this how we shall die?Oh oh ooh, oh oh ooh we're heading for a fall Time is running out, it will soon be too lateWe better act right now, cause tomorrow it's to lateOh oh ooh, oh oh ooh we're heading for a fall "As the world starts to fall""Darkness will come""All forms of life will disappear""And our failure will be complete" Damnation of the worldThe final hour is hereDestruction, horror and painAll hope is lost All we need is one more heroTo ride out from the dark and save us all
Behind the perfect smile lurks the darkA twisted mind who likes controlInside the kindness you'll find hateA heart of ice and no remorse Wake up the world and realize what is wrongOpen up your eyes and see all the things that are goingOnFind the things that we have lost in a world so cold and GreyWhen you see something you don't like don't turn theOther way In a cage born and raised, is that right?The only purpose is to please our greedMan plays god and can do anything, is that right?We only see what we want to see, yeah that's right!
[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]Riding down the valley of the KingsI hear the song of a thousand yearsOnce you've seen the things that I have seenYour soul will die if your mind's not cleanIn the valley of the kingsSteel meets steel once againIn the shadow you will findAll the victims left behindFor a thousand years they've been coming hereTo spill their blood for the KingYou can hear the sounds of the fighting menWho gave their lives again and againDie for your KingAnd the land of the freeAnd the right to believeThe ancient codeWill still carry onAs long as you're heart is realDie for your kingAnd the land of the freeHear the people singDie for your King
[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]It's early in the morningAnd the birds are singing high in the skyI'm watching the sun ariseFor the first time I am feeling aliveI never saw the sign, that the world would come to an endI could never understand, why we all couldn't live in peaceWe don't have much timeWe all have to leave the world behindWhen fire melts the iceThe only hope is here in paradiseWhen fire melts the iceNothing lasts foreverWhen fire melts the iceA thunder storm is comingThe water is rising, there's no way outA fire is still burningBut very soon it all will be lostI can never forget, all the times that we spent togetherI will never regret, that I took a chance and met a strangerWe still have each otherCause we made it through the storm
The heat from the sun, we face a global warningIt's only just begun, it's time to choose or we will loose There'll be no place to call our home, the earth will fade awayThere's no place to run away when the firestorm is here Bright light burns your eyes, no more roses, no paradiseThere will be no escape from the firestorm A tornado of fire is burning everythingThe massive monster of flames, leaving only ashes behind
Inside of this soul there is not much controlWhen the walls are falling downThere is no one to help you when you need it mostYou got to stand your own ground Fortress of SolitudeFortress of crimeFortress of SolitudeDon't waste my time Pictures are flashing and burning my brainHow can I focus with all of this pain?Noises are creeping inside of my earHow can I live my life when all I feel is fear? In good times and bad times you are there for meThe one that I care for but no one can seeThe shadow is dancing a warrior's danceThis time I wont make it, I don't have a chance Fortress of SolitudeYou can't winI won't go downSo don't waste my time
[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]Do you remember the time when I was afraid and aloneYou took me into the light and showed me the way back homeBut the memories are still haunting my mindI try to run away but they are taking me back in timeFreedom calls for you my friendFreedom calls for you againForever time has stood stillAnd now it's time to break freeDo you remember the time when the enemy came to our landThey tried to kill all of us but we had a much better planWe led them into our trap and killed them one by oneAnd when the battle was done our freedom we had wonFrom this hole in the ground I have crawledFor so long I've been coldNow I'm out and a free man I amI'll never be a slave againNever be a slave againI am free, and I owe it all to themAll the young brave men
If I could walk into the fireIf I could walk right through the stormIf you could see my dark desireYou would be dying but not alone If I could stop the world from burningIf I could rescue everyoneIf you could see me in the mirrorYou would be crying all alone Out there, somewhereThe reasons for everythingSearching, fallingDeep into your heart The Hand of fate, is never lateIt will strike right from the skyYou can try to run, but you can not hideFrom the hand of fate Is there a place without no sorrows?Is there a place where we can start?To try an make a new tomorrowOr will it all just fall apart? If we all stand togetherIf we all are ready to fightThere will be a new tomorrowBecause our hope is burning bright
[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]Rain is falling down, All over your graveHope is all I've got, keeps me from going insaneThere is a place far beyondWhere you can go to get the strength to carry onFly far away, to the heavens gateThere you can rest in peaceFly away, to the heavens and you'll findIt's time for you to leave this world behindPain is all I feel, and I just can not believeWhat I see in front of me, your angel is coming for me
[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]The night time has comeThe lights are outIt's time to scream and shoutOnce we go onAnd start to play a songWe all know where we belongIt's time to go wild again, it's time to thrash all aroundIt's time to wake up again, to the loud and heavy soundHeavy metal is in my heart and soulHeavy metal is in my bloodForever the music will live onForever it carry's onHeavy Metal HeartWe enter the stageLike a dog in a cageWaiting to be releasedGrinding our teethAnd we're banging our headsWe all go insane tonight

Beware of the iron curtainOnce it fall you will never get outNever close the door to your heartCause it won't fade away in the night How could this happen to me?I am strong, I am not weak Ah ah The Iron curtain is fallingAh ah And the walls are closing inAh ah The Iron curtain is fallingAh ah My whole world is crumbling downDown on me Sitting trapped in a cornerBoiling sweat runs down my backShaking like an earthquakeAs the anxiety attacks The darkness surrounds meThe weight is heavy as hellMy mind is like a tornadoIt's spinning inside of this well I can't feel my arm anymoreAnd my chest hurts like hellI am crying like a babyAnd I am afraid I won't get well It's the iron curtainsDon't let them fall Here comes the iron curtain
[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen]Going back in time, long before the human kindWhen there was no evil mindsDriven by a force, let the nature take its courseOnly the strongest will surviveBut then the man came like a virus to this worldAnd spread evil to the earth that gave him birthOnce there was no crime, and no greedy selfish mindsMother earth was in controlLiving by the rule, killing just for foodKeep the balance in controlWe are the keepers of time, the guardians of lifeWe know everything that the future will bringEarth wind and fire is what we controlA burning desire that lives in us all, Keepers of TimeLooking back in time, through the history we findThat the humans will not learnMake the same mistakes, as so many have beforeUntil this earth can take no moreKeepers of time, the guardians of lifeThey know everything about the futureWe will take back control, and the evil will fallThere's always a light behind the rainbow
In my heart, in my soulThere is a darkness that could unfoldHold it back, push it down, don't release his evil crownIt's a king, it's a god, it wants' control over my blood Can you hear me now?Or are you lost forever?Trapped inside of your mindCan you see me now?Or are you blinded forever?Please don't leave us all behind In my mind, there is something wrongI can feel it, it won't be longHold it back, push it down, don't release his evil crownIt's a king, it's a god, it wants' control over my blood No more light, no more meI have redrawn myself, and ceased to beYou let it out, you let it loose, the evil crown he nowWill useIt's a king, it's a god, it has control over my blood
A long, long time agoIn a land of ice and snowThe legend of our people was born Be ware of the mighty swordObey Thor the thunder godTo Valhalla we go when we die Row! Row! Out to the seaRow! Row! We're off to see the worldRow! Row! Odin be our guideRow! Row! You cannot break our pride Oh oh oh... Oh oh ohThe fire in our hearts can burn right through your soulTake my life but you can't take my fireOut here on the ocean you don't stand a chance when you seeThe masters of the sea Set sail in the morning sunWhen the wind and the tide is rightFor days they could stay on the sea The North Star they used to navigateIn Gods they would keep their fateThey where travelers of the world
Far to long I have been alone, will I end my life tomorrow?I have tried to keep on going on, but all I get is sorrow No one hears my cry I believe in miracles but will they ever hear meThey seem to be so far away and never coming near meWill it ever be my turn and will I ever see themCause the miracles that I have seen has never been for me A voice inside is telling me to stay, but it's very hard to do itI'm afraid of loosing my mind, if I don't find a solution to it I believe in miracles cause finally they heard meThey used to be so far away but now they are near meFinally it was my turn and finally I saw themCause the miracles that I have seen has always been for me
I feel it, I hear it, I see but can't believe itI fear it, I've tried it, and now I'm free at last We seem to have lost theWill to give a helping handBut it's not to late to make a change A new life has begun (From the darkness he rise)Through the years I have learned to live with the painAs the story unfolds (He reveals all his past)All the secrets is out a new life has begun The hard times, the sadness, it's hard to live and learnYou face it, can't race it, you just have to take your time
So the day did come, when we got our chance to show the worldThat we can be apart, so with this contract we did startWith no cash with no loans, we where making it on our ownBut very soon it got dark, it seemed like it all would fall apart Is there no one who can help us now?Are we lost? Are we out of the game? Will there be no release? Aaaah ah ah ah We had a deal but no it's gone, we cannot finish what we've begunThis can't be right, this must be wrong, where is this hell now coming from?So very close but still so far, will you help us to heal this scar?Time runs fast no hope in sight, our dream was fading in the night There was a light that we did see, was it dream or reality?We must be strong and carry on, because it's here that we belongBut suddenly the things did change, we would break out from our chainsAnd finally we did see, the end of eternity Finally we where seeing the endFinally it would be a release
You thought you could do it againJust change what you want but never askThis time you have gone to farThere's no turning back you'll have to pay Revenge is sweet A contract was written in goldBut turned out to be nothing more than shitYou can take this piece of paperAnd show it up your ass you piece of thrash Paragraph 04 in the contract, brokenParagraph 09 in the contract, brokenParagraph 14 in the contract, brokenParagraph 17 in the contract, broken
Rise of the EmpireThe new world soon will comeRise of the EmpireThe war has just begun Here he comes, the man behind the maskHe holds so much power, he holds the key to the worldHe is no longer human, but a cyborg with no heartNever turn, your back at this manHe holds so many secrets, he holds the truth of the sithHe once was a human, but now he's more machine You will never see the light againIf you don't stand and fightThe dark side is growing powerfulBut with the force we can take them all Watch him fly, he's the fastest in the universeHe has always been a fighter, always been the oneBut with the anger growing stronger, he gets closer to his fall Watch it rise!
Now we all stand togetherTo fight for the right to liveThe air will be cleaner than everWe can breathe without getting a disease From the dark he will comeAnd save everyoneHealing the world with his powerAll the shadows will goAnd we all will knowThat now salvation is here Hate is something that we don't needWe must learn to all get alongYears of fighting will finally endAnd they will see that there was no point at all Salvation is hereComing out from the darkThe day has finally comeWill he will save everyone?
Why do we have to live this way?This is no way of livingCan we find another day without hunger and deceiving?Is there life for all of us?I think that we can make itUnderstand the meaning to life, death and spirit In a world of war and crimeWe are hoping for salvationOut of the ashes we will rise, to fight for every nationLike the eagle in the skyWe see the glance of sunriseThe morning glory for us all, we are standing tall One day we'll live forever for one and all togetherWe all will see the light when we will seize the day
The first time I ever saw your faceI felt something in my heartA feeling that I never knew beforeCould this be a brand new start? I was lost in your eyesCould you be the sun of my life?I thought that I never couldHave someone like you She made me feel so funnyThe feeling was so strangeI love her very easy, It will never change She's the one that I would love, to have and know that IHave met my Sweetie pieAll the days that has gone by, my love will never dieFor her my Spanish eyes The days with you are the best I have hadI hope we will have many moreMy life has changed but I'm still the sameThe Joker and friend for all I am lost in your eyesCause you are the sun of my lifeI thought that I never couldHave someone like you Oh how she looksOh how she smellsI feel a tingling in my bells She's the one that I now love, I have her and I seeThat she's the one for meAll the days that has gone by, my love will never dieFor you my sweetie pieMy Spanish eyes Oh my love it is so true, and it is just for youThe love I've never knewHear these words and you will see, the only one for meIs you my Spanish eyes

Into the story and out of the stormDark times have been beforeA quest for a dream was the strength of it allThe reason to carry on We are fighting for a dream that we haveAnd no one shall stand in our wayNo matter how long it takes, we shall over comeCause believe me the day will come When you will hear a symphony of gloryAs your dreams come trueA victory to show them all that never did believeThe symphony of glory is real Inside every heart there's a fire that burnsBut there are so many rainy daysHold on to your dreams cause they will make you strongAnd in the end your time will come Sometimes life is so hardAnd everyday is a struggle to surviveKeep on dreaming and you will seeThat your dream becomes reality It's the symphony of gloryAnd it's here to stay for eternityThe symphony of gloryThe song of a victory
Another day goes by, another desperate cryA million souls will burn in a lake of fireWhen all we had is lost, no more winter frostA million souls will burn in a lake of fire Is this the point of no return?Is it too late for us to learn?Is this the day that we will pay?Will it all fade away? The savior, will save us, our savior, will save usThe savior, he will come Inside this empty shell, a soul is hidden wellA million dreams will burn in a lake of fireForgotten how to love, but remembers how to hateA million hearts will burn in a lake of fire Now I see there's another way to get out from this hell we createdAll we must do is to change our ways and we all must stand together
Tonight I'm gonna leave this town behindGonna pack my things and then I'll say goodbyeTomorrow a new journey will beginThe iron bird will carry me with the wind As I start to walk awayYou take my hand and then I'll say Every time when I am away from youI feel alone and I am missing youSo far away but still you are close to meIn the stars I see your signNo matter where I go will you wait for me?Even if it will be for eternity?A million miles away but I will returnCause in the stars I see your sign Tomorrow I am far away from homeSeeing places I have never seen beforeSo many men have travelled here beforeAnd many will travel here once more As my journey finally endsI'll return to my friends
Sometimes we have to chooseWe may not like the choice we haveSometimes we're bound to looseIn this game that some call life You feel the heat againYou try to run but you have to stay and jump Through the fire we goYou feel the flames, but nothing brings you downThrough the fire we goYou feel the heat, but this time we let it burn The world is full of crimeThe world is full of hate and painSickness and deceaseHow long can this go on before it ends?
The words I hear is calling out againThey creep inside the darkness of my brainI'm falling down but cannot touch the ground The stream of light is closer than I seeCan I escape from my own destiny?Or am I trapped inside for eternity? Travel through time and space we will help you surviveWatching the years fly byIf we could start again would you help us my friendOr would you not dare to try Something's must change before it is too lateThe time is right we gotta have some fateWe take a journey into the past We see the things that man have done beforeThe evil the terror the destruction of it allIs this really worth fighting for? In the dark you will rise up to light the fire againIn the quest for a reason to start all over again Lost in time the world is falling everything is falling apartNo escape from the terror that looks you in the eye Travel through time and space we will help you surviveTravel to a distant place, a journey to save mankind

[words & music by Thomas C. Hansen] Tonight I'm standing all aloneMy heart is cold as a stone You start to cry, when I tell you whyI have to go away, but I will be back some day There's someone whispering in my earThey tell me dying time is near Don't be afraid we will show you the wayThere's no other place you can goJust close your eyes, and we'll go Open the gate, let us inAnd we'll fight until we winCause surrender is not the thing we doWe will stand side by sideTill there's no more place's to hideYou must fall to your knees and look aboveWatch the sky The stars can tell you where you areThey seem so close but still so far Just watch the skyOne last time before you dieCause you will never see it again
The years are passing by meThe world will change around meAnd life will always be a big illusion So hard to be a part ofA life that's so confusingTo many things is going on inside of me I fly on my ownI decide where to goI have finally foundMy own wings of freedom I speak up my mindI am no longer blindI have finally foundMy own wings of freedom To many times of sorrowTo many lies to swallowI'm breaking loose now and I'm not coming back again I feel the wind around meI see the world below meIt's like I'm born again and finally I'm free
No more blood will flow when I get the powerEveryone will have the right to say what they wantNo more! No more illusions you will hear the truth this timeJust give me your vote and I will save your soul Falling into the same trap againNever learning so hear me when I sayYou are a liar!  I see you on my TV, I hear the things you sayBla bla bla bla, bla bla bla bla blaYou keep making promises that you will never keepCorruption is the game but I don't want to play Liar, liar, pants on fire!  You are a liar and liars will fallYour aiming higher but I'm gonna take you down
