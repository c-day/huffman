Ll Bells ringing, it's my wake-up shoutI know the way outIt's five past twelve, we'd better runA new age has begunHush, little darling, don't you cryI am your favourI am your answer, I'm your lightI'm your saviour Oh, I know where we're going, I hold the key to our fateLet's face a new morning before it's too late See! A new age has begunI will get youTo a time of brightest lightEmpty is my name and I am right You think your life will bring you downJust clean up your mindI am enlightened, I have comeJust to lead the blind Oh, no tar and no feathers whith answers so close at handI'll drive you to madness, but that's what you want!  See! A new age has begun...  I am the insect inside your mindThe buzzing noise that you can't findOver your shoulder, inside your headI turn the switch from good to badMaterial saviour with bank accountGlad for the bliss that you have foundA VISA-master, cards up my sleeve, Appreciate what you leave See! A new age has begun.
I am the one that is walking the nightSleepless I'm dreaming- eyes wide openWatching the sky for the ashes to fallEndless illusions- I keep on hoping For this world to survive- to keep me alive So for all you ever desired, you wanted to beWas shining so bright but only a dreamAnd nothing remains but this fantasyOh this world is falling down Frozen by gold that has turned me to iceI kept all these secrets deep inside me Now I will pass them on- no, now you are the one So for all...  Et audivi vocem magnam dicentem septem angelisEffundite septem fialas asperitae mundi in somniumVidi cum aperuisset sigillum sextumTerrae motus factus estMagnus sol factus est niger luna tota facta est sicut sanguis And as it opened the final sealI stood alone on crumbled groundThe stars had fallen And the sun was cold This world has never beenOnly for the seeing it will be seenI was given the seal and the keyAnd I will keep it until I die It's falling down for you
Last embrace, last words to sayBefore the war took their fate awayBefore to kill became his forced taskAnd bleeding fields were covered with sinsHis wounded heart is crying out for home Away away my love to where all darkness will be goneAway away to our landWhere you will be forever in my arms again Days of dust, of cruelty and deathBroke his soul until there was nothing leftOnly her love that carried him through all He passed high mountains and rough riversHe wrote a 1000 letters to be nearHe walked a 1000 milesJust to see her smile againJust for returning home Away away my love...  Tell the wind I'll survive just to feel you againI will fight 'till the end to lay my promised loveForever in your hands
We fought the truthAs long as we lived our loveFearing all the solutions we foundWe drowned ourselvesIn the lake of tears theat we cried'Til we found out that love is its groundCall me a fool, but I'm notOur love changed - and love changed meI kept waiting for your answerThen I found out the answer was youNo more riddles of my longingsNow I Know that the answer is youI want to thank you, my creatorI still wouldn't live my life without you
I can recall my name - but it was not the sameI fear I'd gone astray - I've almost gone insaneSometimes I still can hear - echoes of silent fearsBut on that winter's day - you swept them all awayThese were the times when I longed for the riverAnd I closed my eyes and yo laid your handy down on meMot just a burning sin - a candle in the windIt was so much more - I want to thank you forI can see you, still my friendStill so deep inside of meYou filled my void, you let me flyYou broke my chains, you showed me lifeYou set me up, you made me trueI was back at the river with you
I dress myself in blackIn black from head to heelsI take my promise backCause you don't know how it feelsNo, you don't take me as I amNo, you don't want to know at allWho is the face behind the maskI'll be the one who'll make you fallBeware! Beware! I'll be the oneThe one to take you underBeware!I hate the light of dayI'm happy when it rainsThe stars shine on my wayBut the memory remainsNo, you don't take me as I am...Beware! Beware! I'll be the one...I am the night's revengeI've got a soul to sellAnd yet a fist to clenchSo wait for me in hellBeware! Beware! I'll be the one...Wait for me in hellI'll see you in hell
Incinerate my skinAnd touch me far far beyondBurn me out, my sinAnd take me deeper undergroundI know it's way too lateWhen this dance has begunSo put on the heatAnd let the fire runTake me away, my black flameImmaculate you areIn your tender violenceAnd when you touch my heartI'll always lower my defenseDon't let me wait too longCause I don't like to be saveWe know we can't go wrongOn our way through time and spaceTake me away, my black flame
Black & SilverI am amusedYou seem to love meBut be reservedBefore you huff meI'm used to winnersI need the fameAnd if you touched meYou'd be my shameYour childish dreams are all in vainTo me your kind is all the sameA starlit skyOf black and silver is my coreMy last goodbyeMakes you want me even moreFor silver is my fameBlack is my nameI am a queenAnd if you creepI'll push my bladeStill-water-deepI am a dreamA fairy-taleYour endless questYour holy grailThanks so much for your confusionI will be your lost illusionDeep insideThe silver shines as black as can beMy disguiseThe wolf among the sheep, you want meTo me your kind is all the sameTo me your kind is all the same
Silver stars in my black nightCold as ice but beautifulWandering through broken shadowsThe river of life is all filled with sinsThe water I drink is the blood on my hands No-one sees how I'm burningNo-one feels this yearningSo come taste this black poison - You never reach this heartAnd forgive my obsession - Something tears me apartFrom myself Silver stars...  Waiting for my damnation - your prosecutor's hereIn my own accusation - you can't run from yourselfOh we're living these lies all aloneSo come on and throw the stone Silver stars...  Pray to the gods I have sold in this game of life and let diePray for my soul in this world to deliver me from my sinsPray...  All that's been and all I see nowOnly a ghost of what I called...  Silver stars...  Blood on my hands.Blood on my hands.
Come and sail along the shores of your homelandSee the waves that break onto the walls surrounding all Tell meWhy have you lost all your wildest desires?Where is the treasure to die for?Is there a heart that longs for the unknown in yourself?No one else but you can...  Sail away to the end of the seas, The land of dreams, the child to releaseOnce the horizon is left behindAll you will hear's the Call of the Wind Leave behind the land that has been turned to greyWhere the winds have whispered only from so far away AskingWhy don't you face all your wildest desires?When is the time that you wait for?There will be nothing to lose but your fearSo come on - and follow me now Sail away...  Voluntas numerit anima viva Wishes are still sleeping in your heart Sail away...  Turn the page and follow the linesThrough words of fear and hidden signsSomeday the story unveils what's withinAnd it is yours, the voice of the wind Come and try to fight your demons awayBefore the coldness drives you insane

Keep yourself from falling into cursed deep waters...  Have you been to the waterHave you gone with the tideHave you heard of strange creaturesBeware of the moonlight Down falls the light as they rise from the seaIn comes the night, give your soul, pay your feeLiving a curse, they were born by their sinsSoon life and death will become evil twins Bound to go where the wind blowsBound to serve the unrealBound to dwell in deep watersGreed and fear cast their seal Cursing their non-livesLiving a curse is their lotLife without sensesSeeking escape from this plot

I've been dreaming all those yearsI've been sleeping for so longIn a diamond sky of lonely worlds All your eyes stare up at meAs if I was wide awakeAnd I only can live my own curse I will keep your dreamMake it live for realOnly just for a momentI will send a dying roseFor you all to be closeTo its scent that has never been All the colors to unfoldAll the magic we beholdIn the life we share in fantasy I will keep your dreamMake it live for realOnly just for a momentSay these words againDon't leave me aloneWhen my own dreams have finally died Keep my dream nowI keep yours foreverSave my hope nowI save yours foreverHold meHelp meCarry me upon your wingsTo save my soulWith your love I will keep your dreamMake it live for realOnly just for a momentSay these words againDon't leave me aloneWhen my own dreams have finally died Keep my dreams nowI keep yours foreverSave my hope nowI save yours foreverHold meHelp meWill you be my dream-keeper?
Watch my poster on the wallView my pictures on the magazines you store to have them allLet me be your guiding lightBe the salt inside the wounds of your most ordinary life Come closer - what you want is what you seeDesire - but you won't dare talk to me So pure a lie - a hymn for the emotional manSo clean and shy - get it while you canAnd yes, what I am is not what you seeYour interest's somewhere elseYour carnal longings make you all the same Writing letters, sending mailsOffering me your honest interest in what's inside of meNo sins on your mind, of coursePretend to intellectualize another wasted girl resource You tell me - you knew what I needSo sorry - for the hypocrit I feed So pure a lie...  Just a number in a game - you tell me I had a nameCreation of an industry - and not what you might think to seeGlorify an icon's shrine - whose image of me is not mineNot to save you from your mess - tell you you may kiss...  So pure a lie...
Serpent angel rape meSerpent venom in me O Euphoria, our goddess you areTake the burden away to live in this hellSay goodbyes to the dreams, destroyed fantasiesBitter nightfall at hand, will cover the land Foresees come- silentCrosses your mind- blindingAnesthetize- sensesSteal them all away Caress you- grievousInfest you- with lustEnding soon- chaosServant life is waiting Consume the drugs we sell to youKeep you begging for moreAnd soon you will forgetThe world you were longing for Childish dreams- sinfulI have seen- passionFearlessly- chainlessAll this hope is forever lost O Euphoria... Neverworld's End We sell you a false dream for your ownSo we can control your fantasiesThere's no hideaway this world is oursGiven in to our plastic paradise Endlessly traveling the plains of my dreamSlowly it's fading in my memory O Euphoria, sweet lies that you areLet the child fade away, just memories stayO Chimaria, predacious heartTake our souls with you, Forever repentNeverworld's End
Once I traveled seven seas to find my loveAnd once I sang seven hundred songsWell, maybe I still have to walk seven thousand milesUntil I find the one that I belongI will rest my head side by sideTo the one that stays in the nightI will lose my breath in my last words of sorrowAnd whatever comes will come soonDying, I will pray to the moonThat there once will be a better tomorrowOnce I crossed seven rivers to find my loveAnd once for seven years I forgot my nameWell, if I have to, I will die seven deaths just to lieIn the arms of my eversleeping aimI will rest my head side by sideTo the one that stays in the nightI will lose my breath in my last words of sorrowAnd whatever comes will come soonDying I will pray to the moonThat there once will be a better tomorrowI will rest my head side by sideTo the one that stays in the nightI will lose my breath in my last words of sorrowAnd whatever comes will come soonDying I will pray to the moonThat there once will be a better tomorrowI dreamt last night that he came to meHe said, "My love, why do you cry?For now it won't be long any moreUntil in my cold grave we will lieUntil in my cold grave we will lie"

Close to the flameBehind my eyes there is a beastThat longs for youCalling my nameSo if you're brave enough to risk itFollow meInto the firestorm Have you ever been inside a flame?Did you ever play a burning game?Would you do what I want you to do?Do you like the way I'm burning you? There's no need to be afraid of thisLet me melt you with my dragon-kissLet me walk with you the firing linePut your burn onto the heart of mine (I. Will. Burn. You.) Yesterday I had a flaming dreamWe were swimming in a lava streamWe were watching an exploding sunCounting sparkles until they were gone

Once there was a time of a never-ending dreamOf being free, of immortalityWhen a song was a mysteryAnd the stars so easy to reachBut something changed, now the sand's trickling slowThe time of innocence is over now I know the rivers won't be flowing on forevermoreThe wind of time blows right into my eyesMy flower withers and so do they allNothing lasts forevermore Why is my fate that I will never seeThe story's end, the final truth to beAnd to you lights that help me through the darkMy greatest fear is losing your spark I know...  I see the days go by and feel the snow is falling downI've seen the end is waiting by my sideThe dream is lost, once I was toldIt's gone forevermore
Something infests me when I'm aloneIt's lunacyI want to vomit, spit out my lifeSo queer is seemsRetract your reverence and slander meI'm the traitor of mineA close-up picture of my lost chastityThere's nothing left of me anymoreand no rain can wash away those bloody tearsAs sweet sounds of destruction reach my earsRed lips like roses call my nameBut laughter is all the woman of now hearsin gloom I wander, it batters meThough I subsist of itThe smell of incense arouses meAbeyance maddens meA ginger sunset is my caressAs I expireAs music's fading I fade withinThere's nothing left of me anymoreand no rain can wash away those bloody tearsAs sweet sounds of destruction reach my earsRed lips like roses call my nameBut laughter is all the woman of now hears
No more tearsI'm out of fearsI'm out of painI'm out in the rain It will gently wash awayThe light of the day I'm in love with the darkness of the nightI'm in love with all that's out of sightI'm in love with the magic of the newAnd the darkness loves me, too FinallyIt covers meIt makes me tasteIt's sure embrace It will gently take awayThe sorrows of the dayCome out, come out wherever you areDon't hide, don't hide near or farDon't hide

Follow me through the nightWe are sisters of the lightWe are daughters of sinWe are laughter in the windFollow me through the nightWe are sisters of the lightWe are wild, we are freeThrough the darkness follow me!  I am here to break the silence andI want you to be the voice of mine Follow me now Follow me through the night...  You alone, you can let time stand still andYou create the missing element We're the fires of hellWe're the deep rough seaWe're the stormy airWe are weWe're the ashes of timeAnd we are bansheeThrough the darkness, sisters, Follow me!  Follow me now Follow me through the night...
Night falls down and soon we're all aloneWhat do you have in mind, guidance of the blind, I feel lostLost inside this maze of shame and sinA taste of sweetest wine, addictive yet so fine, I want moreThe conscience says no, all senses yell go, There's too much at stake this timeThe more I deny, the more I commit to this night Don't tell me what you feel, don't tell me what you seeClose your eyes and stay behind the sceneAny alibi will be one step over the lineDo you feel my pain, do you share my fearsSo right even if I die tonightWill I pay the price at the edge of time?Let sleeping dogs lie Time stands still, the room seems frozen nowTwo creatures moving in a game of lose or win, right or wrongStep aside, losen this strangleholdMay heaven's fires burn the point of no return, sensual thorn My head's spinning round, waiting to fall, fall for a secret desireToo far to starve yet too close to breathe in this lie Gonna make your sleeping dogs fly

I breathe the scent of your hair (Your emerald eyes are closed) There's still some music in the air (Feels like time no more flows) We sit, you're in my arms (Watching the first daylight gleam)You say, "I like your warmth" (A voice just in a dream)I was dreaming of the wind I was dreaming like a child A prince and princess fairy tale And so you disappear I was dreaming of the fire Of the time when it was wild I was dreaming far too sweet And so you disappear In chaos waters I do swim(And you're the stone one's thrown into)A frail creature now gets dim(As the gold turns into blue)Made me think you were so damn near(Like a bright shining star)But reaching out, you disappeared(For real you are so very far)I was dreaming of the windI was dreaming like a childA prince and princess fairy taleAnd so you disappearI was dreaming of the fireOf the time when it was wildI was dreaming far too sweetAnd so you disappearI was dreaming of the windI was dreaming like a childA prince and princess fairy taleAnd so you disappearI was dreaming of the windI was dreaming like a childA prince and princess fairy taleAnd so you disappearI was dreaming of the fireOf the time when it was wildI was dreaming far too sweetAnd so..(I dreampt of the wind)I'd run, so sweet(I dreampt like the child)I'd burn, so sweet(I dreampt of the fire)(Of the time it was wild)I'd run, so sweet(I dreampt of the wind)(I dreampt like the child)I'd burn(I dreampt of the fire)And so you disappeared
Glamourous stars darken the dayThe shadows of night lighten their wayThe wisdom of fools is ot easy to learnSo go one step ahead and two in returnI am the sense in all of your tearsI am the reason of all your fearsI am praised for my sadnessI am praised for my faultsI am praised for my madnessCause some like it hotAnd some like it coldEvening calls the sunset to riseI am a liar so take care of my adviceThe wheel of fortune always goes roundWhatever goes up must always come down
I know the truth behind you, there is nothing but fearHiding behind violence I felt year after yearSearching for someone to pay Darwin's priceLaughter echoes while you savour my cries I can't forget it - the pain and the dirt that I had to swallowThis is the limit - the soul you rape will once be strongYou never get it - the tears of the past are the hate of tomorrowCursed Soulcrusher There's no escape, everyday is a treadmill of painWorking so hard for respect, but it all was in vainNo one would help little chaps picked half-deadIt's evolution, the strongest survive I can't forget it...  There's a refuge for me, but only in my mindOutside it's raging on, on and on Abusing for lust, instinct thirst for bloodHunting day by day - tears will run dry to hateFor the weakest one is hacked till it's doneTill it's falling out of the nest, dead and goneThis sublime system of pure selectionGuarded carefully by the lies unquestionedIt is living on - it is killing onWhile the protectors just watch Do you really wonder when sometimes the revenge is on you?
We have come a long wayThrough rain and the dust of timeTimes full of wondersFull of secret signs We have seen the wintersAnd the sunlight's brightest shineBut not every single momentCan stand the test of time The song now has endedAnd the last notes fade awayBut a new one beginsThe music will stay Now it's time for the futureWe left our past behindAll the battles are overBut the dream is still alive Smoke has been risingNow it's blown away by the windIt's all getting clearerI wonder where I've been A past destined to fall downThe final brick in the wallWas so hard for me to seeBut now I see it all Now it's time for the future...  No-one can take it away from meNo day will ever let it end Now it's time for the future...  Now we see our tomorrowThe night is long agoAll the fighting is overBut the dream is still alive

Cerulean sky over dessert fields and sand veilsAnd underneath a lioness is stalking narrowing ringsFeel her coming near, she smells the blood, her prey is nearSo see her, hear her, feel her, be herThe lioness is hunting usSo beautiful and dangerousHer embrace is murderousBeware of the lionessDo you feel her gentle touchHer sweet caress hurts just as muchSo take care, take care of herThe lioness will winSo close you hear her purringSo close she smells your fearNot close enough to lose yourselfBeware - the lioness is near
For the lost desire, the star of once been higherLight the face of dead worlds, forever in my heart For the lost Elysion Rivers of red run through the landCover the ruins of once golden pastWhen starlight was strong and I did belongTo the almighty light Burned are the homes where dreams could be bornThe whispers of hope, into hate they are tornLetters to fate, tears like a bladeWisdom of Shar-Ilya For the lost desire...  Secrets are lost, arbors are crossedThe doors of this house will forever be closedNothing remains, all full of stainsThe colours are fading away This world full of fear, of lies in my earsThis peace is so false, only greed is sincereOh how I wish to be once releasedBut nothing will turn back time For the lost desire...  Born from grace and silence, blissful sound of sirensFor the lost Elysion can never be found again Silence fell down, broken the crownNow it will never be anyone's ownIn this weary world, it's cruelty unfurledFrozen until we die Trying to hold a piece of this goldBack in my heart till it all will be soldSo I hold the key to open and seeThe world behind the lies I can almost create the picture before my eyes againBut most of it has been washed away for yearsGone for being able to live in this world
Silent are the winds as he travels forgotten landsOutcast, yet not fallen, and no-one knows his name May the winds do once rise againMay the magic be strong to standFor the dark and the light to comeSoon to an end to give a new way Over the mountains from the tower above the worldSecrets were given for in his hands to unfold Will the winds do once rise again?Will the magic do lead his hand?For the dark and the light to comeSoon to an end to give a new way? For this contest to endNot from hell or heaven sentTo renew the beauty of allAll of the kings have to fall It's been a long way from the forsaken prisonSeeing the downtrodden ones serve false mastersThe rivalry of gods must end here once and for all Knowing the desire for the crown will lead nowhereDown there in the fire of the forge it has to burn Now the winds do rise againNow the peace will come to the landFor the dark and the light to comeNow to an end to give a new way We wait for you only - release our world, unfold itThe beauty, the broken - come forth for us and heal itBe the one, you nameless - and leave us with our freedomOur freedom
I am like the endless oceanCarry dreams to distant shoresYou are like the wind that moves meWhispering breeze and roaring storm Azure is my gardenI grow some seaweed on the groundI sleep and dream of naiadsAnd of the sunk ships that I found I am like the endless ocean...  Through the rough sea's currentMy blue heart's drawn to your caressI'll give you salty kissesHow do you like my glittering dress? Seawards, seawardsSail your vasselsHuman plaything for my wavesSeawards, seawardsSail your vassels'Til my seabed is your grave I am like the endless ocean...
We played with the fireBurning souls in the flamesCall me a liarBut now it's not the sameSilently creepingSoon we were torn apartBy what once was sleepingIn the shadows of my heart- forgive me -Too close to breathe he came to meUnder my skin, making me highI didn't look for what I seeTo less to live too much to dieOf loveHeart, don't believeYou don't remind me ofJoy & griefThough both they are goneYou left me grey and without a core insideAnd I left myself by leaving you angry this night
Be the valentine, rip the heart of mineGive your innocence to the brightest of dreamsThis is harvest time, taste the bloodred wineOf this gilded art, it is spilled from my own heartIt?s so hard to see my faceIn the mirror?s cold disgraceI wonder what is this I have becomeA childish forlorn wishSo easy to seduceSeems like it?s just one step to fall downBe the valentine?I can hardly write these linesCause I already have signedMy name across the wall of prayersNow I listen to my nameSounding like a blameI close my eyes and start to sing my songBe the valentine?If I?m looking back behindTo long forgotten timesThere?s something that is burning on and onOh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis! Oh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis! Oh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis! Oh, oh, oh, pactum fraudis! Sanguinans!I live in memories, cast into melodiesThey die in harmony with greed and treacheryBe the valentine?How can I run from this hurting neverending pain?

Took sense and madness as they comeThis circus life has left me on my own My expectations were my homeBut when the mirror cracks- there's so much left undone Who betrayed and who deceived?Loss of what I once believed Feel I'm in a dream- scary scenes rush before my eyesWake up in a scream- this is realWhere's my paradise?Downed my circumstance- innocence crushed under this loadWill it ever end, where's my life? Disastrous certainties once feltMy vast collection of a better time to tell Knowing my worst enemyWeak and helpless- is this me? Feel I'm in a dream- scary scenes rush before my eyesWake up in a scream- this is realWhere's my paradise?Downed my circumstance- innocence crushed under this load Late comprehension, a new dimension, a newborn child in it's fragile world[X4] Feel I'm in a dream- scary scenes rush before my eyesWake up in a scream- this is realWhere's my paradise?Downed my circumstance- innocence crushed under this loadWill it ever end, where's my life? [x2]

We scintillate like cedar stonesIn plasma veil as ancient onesIn cold war years you were my fearsBut just to gain the power to reignSatan's bllod in our veinsThe pigfaced mud will be slaynBut no one dies when blackseas dryAnd no one kill. forever this willOur wisdom beNow you're askingWhat are you living forNo sense of lifeAnd none afterwardsWhat I call wisdom is a flowerThat can seldom be foundBut not in illusionsYou only use to findA way out
