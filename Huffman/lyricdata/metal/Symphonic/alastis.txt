I can catch rolls from outsideI'm here for a long time, setting in the darkAnd lost again in my dreams... Till my birth I was waiting, I was waiting for the final actAnd tonight I will meet the greatness,I've chosen to do all that's possibleTo keep higher the flame of liberty But my destiny was not to survive.So, I'm ready but I still have questions...Is it the right way?Have I respected the rules?And if, would it not be the last passage? Tonight, the final act, tonight, on the wayTonight... the returnTonight, on the way with the godsTonight... the returnTonight, tonight...alone and free! Tonight, the final act, tonight, on the wayTonight... the returnTonight, on the way with the godsTonight, I'm on the wayTonight, to the other side I don't want to know... why?It's all the same for meWhy?... don't believe in meWhy?... Please, look inside... You've already met me!
Everyone knows meEveryone loves meEveryone dreads meEveryone respects me Soulless, maybe a wizardFree from... I'm just another god Everyone knows himClose at hand shades... a real presenceSo far at the stars, behind this closed doorA sensation! The presence which gets away Soulless, maybe crazyFree from... I'm just another... god ! I don't have my own existenceBut alone I respond to more than a thousand namesI've never appeared physicallyBut they've portrayed me under multiple appearancesNestled in your unconsciousI'm born with the night, your nightFrom your obscurest thoughtsI stand out... master or fiend I'm born with the nightI stand out mirror of your nightmaresI'm born with your nightEcstasy's angel, the Reign of Terror I can exhaust my soulI can deride your prideI'm free from all beliefsI'm just another god Everyone knows himEveryone loves himEveryone dreads himEveryone respects himSoulless, maybe crazyFree from, I'm just another god!
Seeing that you can't expect more from lifeSeeing that anger governs your actsSeeing that you can't accept the common rulesSeeing that I'm your only chance to survive No need for a god or prayersNo need for a head or rulesNo need for limits for your wishesNo need for morals for the stories Seeing that no one shall believe in youSeeing that no one shall listenSeeing that betrayed by illusionsSeeing that I'm your cure facing death For your fearsFor your faithFor your life and for your deathFor your life-sickness and for your doubtFor your god and prayersFor your head and rules, for your wishesFor your power, for your lifeI am the antidote I know you're looking for convictionsI know the questions that restrain you...But do you feel able to denyRemorse, shame, taboo? You deny Church but worship SatanYou favour evil but you're afraidSo begin to understandI'm the antidoteAnd you have to accept me as the antidote No need for a god or prayersNo need for a head or rulesNo need for limits for your wishesNo need for morals for the stories Seeing that you can't expect more from the lifeSeeing that anger governs your actsSeeing that you can't accept the common rulesSeeing that I'm your only chance to survive

From his darkest desiresFrom hate caused by his sufferingFrom his horde of faithfuls in tranceFrom his thirst of blood and deathWill be born a storm of torporAnd horror succeeds hypocrisyLast judgement will be proclaimed For a long time the executioner waits for themHe won't have a pityThe fire of live coals already burn When flames of pureness turn over inquisitionWhen flower of evil spreads as a death windWhen blood pours on last sabbath's a dark altarThen he will come back and declare his reignAnd hunt Jehovah's angels from his people's soul. Then christ will return on his crossIt will be the Holy Trinity's endThe humiliated prince goes back on his throneAnd story can finally start... By the holy road you returnBy your sacrifice's bloodBy gift of your soul to the masterAnd reject of church's baptismYou calm torment of his spiritYou give him force to fightAnd your help will be rewarded!

While the minds sway to the unknownWhile the fears turn into braveryGood like evil doesn't mean anythingThe awake power has chosen it's side To rise my aura to the other sideTo break the cloak of sympathyTo penetrate the secret of the worldsTo recover the sense of existence To know the spiritual peaceTo create light and darknessTo recover the path to EternityTo brave evil I've done and the one I shall do... I'm waiting for you, don't straggle on the waySet me free from this bodyPrisoner of matter, slave of rotI need again my liberty Planned of the mercy of stormsThousand freaks stand out against the darknessThey twinkle and dance in spaceHypnotize their victims in ghastly fanciesAnd take delight on their bad thoughtsGhastly fancies! Ghastly fancies!And take delight on their bad thoughts To rise my aura to the other sideTo break the cloak of sympathyTo penetrate the secret of the worldsTo recover the sense of existenceTo know the spiritual peaceTo create light and darknessTo recover the path to EternityTo brave evil I've done and the one I shall do,I shall do in ghastly fancies...
