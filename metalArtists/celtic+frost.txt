By masquerade of sleep madness ever luresResting soul's rebirth, denying the depths of fearNecropolis Built from mortal bonesDeath descends inside the darkened mindA thousand cries in pain, spread beneath the fallA kiss glowing above, feeding upon the heartSpells, on glory they ride from withinLight, as they seed hate onto the pathA kiss or a whisperFloods of hate without relief for all sinister sleepShadows of eternal belief
Lights have faded - euphoria is deadPast and present - exalt of the weirdChimerias petrified - eclipse and suspicionDeafened stream - babylon fell Distraction and envy, babylon fellFestal perishing, babylon fell Dreams drift in the frozen windAnd mysteries are rebornWe rose from sand and stoneTo follow the light's allure Tears drift in the shadows sleepTurn innocence into excessFragments of a dying worldAnd destiny lies beneath Sceptres of bombast - tracks into mythFetish and feud - dance of recessesFierce laughter - banned into stoneEyes of guilt - covered by sand

On days of northern wind, (past) illusions surround my dreamsDrops of mute oceans breath in the palm of my handThe sound of silent waves still caresses all my thoughtsWhere warm, mystic floods dominated the upper hemisphere(And) dark ships sailed beyond those lost realmsThrough gates to eternity, above the sleeping mindForever inconquerable seemed the walls of timeTo those who always feared and always fled the dawnBut then, the guardians growl invited the thirst for steeIPart god, part man, if I walked by their sideThe old man's dream now has ended much too soonForgotten rests the wisdom that brought them once so farVanished until rebirth, we sleep the endless sleepFor one who knows never tries to reappear

Is it addiction to prevailOr mute marble wordsMy heart. coarse and fallenInto the sandOblivion into griefMillenniums perishPillars of desireTherefore I have seenMeurt et seductionDes comptes morbidesTasting rhetoric hateAn attraction verifiedFall of lusterAnd fake caressesMundane beggarsCostume of deathA purified doctrineAnd communal repentanceMy mortalized questThe enigma still unbornOceans of grime and stoneShores of wasted mightSoaring remains forfeitMy visionary dreamWings of lustTemptation and fameTemples of prowessLeft a man among ruinsCaress into oblivion
Dancing violet dreams.Joining nights of satin fame.Acting jewel games.All forgiven, you streak my heart.More than pleasure in ice cold flames.Crying soft, as love flies tame.Swelling tears in diaries of lies.Fading lights, as songs die quiet.Bleeding sweet for dying blind.Masking fears of silent decline.Cherry Orchards. Ginger looks upon pain.Cherry Orchards. August fades like tears in vain.Winter's final shine. Dressing gold, one last time.Seep from lace. Roses for an unborn face.Cherry Orchards. Ginger looks upon pain.Cherry Orchards. August fades like tears in vain.
After the battle is overAnd the sands drunken the bloodAll what there remainsIs the bitterness of delusionCircle of the tyrantsThe immortality of the godsSits at their sideAs they leave the walls behindTo reach the jewel's gleamCircle of the tyrantsThe days have comeWhen the steel will ruleAnd upon his headA crown of goldYour hand wields the mightThe tyrant's the precursorYou carry the willAs the morning is nearI sing the balladsOf victory and defeatI hear the talesOf frozen mysteryYour hand wields the mightThe tyrant's the precursorYou carry the willAs the morning is nearThe new kingdoms riseBy the circle of the tyrantsIn the land of darknessThe warrior that was meGrotesque gloryNone will ever see them fallAnd hunts and warsAre like everlasting shadowsWhere the winds cannot reachThe tyrant's might was bornAnd often I look backWith tears in my eyesGrotesque gloryNone will ever see them fallAnd hunts and warsAre like everlasting shadows

Humiliated in human formWe have to die to be rebornAwaiting the final judgmentThe dawn now liftsSubjects of fleshSlaves of lustThe cross has failedYou won't see the coming fallA diviner's fire and soilFlames, like flowers, like bloodFires of freedom, flowers of doomA surface of hateful hopeOh subjects of painLovers of deathYou will feelThe yearning flamesFlames like tongues, like criesPant for kisses For bitesSeven stepsAnd we're oneHumiliated In human thoughtsThe frost, it bitesYour inner heartFrozens the flameIn every eyeThe lord will comeBroken iceThe fire will burnGleaming waysWell never be rebornPrenatal death's redeemed (our lives)(Into his hand) we demand our heartsThe lord and we are one
See the portal, gate to madnessLocked forever in a veil of shameDeny extraction Thirst for disgraceWatch his break The emperor's killedLight of the day Shadows from beyondScaffold of steel The throne has goneDethroned emperorThe foot of the stairs, dimension in mightThe king sits, his eyes are glassGrowing of the small The laughter's fallCan you deny Remaining cries?Descent of the lords Into the trapExistence and hate Unseen gateDethroned emperor
Four arc lights. Moving stealth.Two ride up north. Into the barrel fear.Desire to share.

The pyramids tremble, darken the sun, (the) sky tums redThey reached the wall of no return (and the) breeze has stoppedWho wore the crown will never be known, might is brokenFor all we'll drown into the sand, what will remain?Inverted horizons, denied truth and blinded eyesThe Titans arise, the monuments fall, we cannot haltWishful pleads at last came true, some always knewThe clouds burn - or is it fire? The gods winceHuman pride and megalomania The Titans watched it allThe trace led to nowhere Wrath had to comeAs ushers at the gates To ecstasy and excessAll turn their backs They won't give us any rest(The) fires won't redeem, illuminated's the night - the eternal summerWhen they came high from the sphere on shrieking wings Now they're trapped to the ground, to heat and dustAnd the eye is glowing above
Try to see through fainted viewsAs reality disappears in hazeA journey between eternal walls The senses unfold before my eyesAs the endless dreams begin to reignAnd my hands slip off the edgeThe waters grow dumbWhile they descend (behind)Fainted eyesDrifting in the streams of wisdomWhile recognizing all those banal talesSin beyond truth, (I see) glimmering splintersEncountering my past in flickering whispersWhile they drown behind their frontiersAnd the rulers sink in agonyFallacy and false idolsUnbelievable is the human directionBut the screams die away in the distanceTry to see through fainted viewsBut the dust still covers all my dreamsI wouldn't tell you anyway
[Originally performed by David Bowie] I will be kingAnd youYou will be queenThough nothing willDrive them awayWe can beat themJust for one dayWe can be HeroesJust for one day And youYou can be meanAnd II'll drink all the time'Cause we're loversAnd that is a factYes we're loversAnd that is that Though nothingWill keep us togetherWe could steal timeJust for one dayWe can be HeroesFor ever and everWhat d'you say II wish you could swimLike the dolphinsLike dolphins can swim Though nothingWill keep us togetherWe can beat themFor ever and everOh we can be HeroesJust for one day II will be kingAnd youYou will be queenThough nothingWill drive them awayWe can be HeroesJust for one dayWe can be usJust for one day II can rememberStandingBy the wallAnd the gunsShot above our headsAnd we kissedAs though nothing could fallAnd the shameWas on the other sideOh we can beat themFor ever and everThen we can be Heroes Just for one day We can be HeroesWe can be HeroesWe can be HeroesJust for one dayWe can be HeroesWe're nothingAnd nothing will help usMaybe we're lyingThen you better not stayBut we could be saferJust for one day

I did taste their only dreamAs denial was still unbornSecrets beyond those dethroned wallsAnd echoes of a martyr's screamDeterrent vibrates the allurements faceAs my barque drowns toward conquestDon't quieten the elder's tearsFor they've foreseen our pastCovered lies our remembranceAs symbols turn to dustI won't danceI won't danceI won't dance within despairI won't danceThe elder's orientJourney into a wicked worldMy body beneath the skiesErotic wishes, my heart has failedIncalculable is the surface's breathParalyzed form - the ring of deathSteps on the stairs to my silent ecstasyCaress of the mental spaceThrones of fake lifeEternal addiction towards those eyes(Gods) didn't you believe my earthbound call?Slipping into the hidden sunIntoxicated by an endless fall
What kind of race, lack of directionJust how lunatic, to have a nature so deceitBewail my reverie, a gambol untriedLure of carnality and silence in forfeitAnimals, enslaved to pearls of fictionalized worthCreatures, born from caves into simulated mirthI'm talking, Idols of ChagrinBorn of possession, complacement in disguiseCraving and candid, as to defy the character's fallThe kisses you drain, pedestrian pedigreeWhat's thought is pain might be desire after all
How I'd love to hear the organIn the chapel, in the moonlightWhile we're strolling down the aisleWhere roses entwineHow I'd love to hear you whisperIn the chapel, in the moonlightThat the love light in your eyesForever will shine'Till the roses turn to ashes'Till the organ turns to rustIf you never come I'll still be there'Till the moonlight turns to dustHow I'd love to hear the choirIn the chapel, in the moonlightAs they sing, 'Oh promise meForever be mine''Till the roses turn to ashes'Till the organ turns to rustIf you never come I'll still be there'Till the moonlight turns to dustHow I'd love to hear the choirIn the chapel, in the moonlightAs they sing, 'Oh promise meForever be mine'In the chapel in the moonlight, oh boy
Sleep brings no joy to meRemembrance never diesMy soul is given to miseryAnd lives in sighs The shadows of the dead,My waken eyes may never see,Surround my bedThat from which they sprung - eternityBeneath the turfThe silent deadSleep brings no wish to knitMy harassed heart beneathMy only wish is to forgetIn the sleep of deathDeath is my joyI long to be at restI wish the damp earth coveredThis desolate brestBeneath the mouldThe silent deadBut the glad eyes around usMust weep as we have doneAnd we must see the same gloomEclipse their morning sunOh not for them Should we despairThe grave is drear But they're not thereTheir dust is mingled With the sodTheir pale souls Are gone, to godWell, may they live in ecstasyTheir long eternity of joyAt least I wouldn't bring them downWith me to weep, to groanAnd what's the futureA sea beneath the cloudless sunA mighty, glorious, dazzling seaStretching into infinityMy inner sanctumR.I.P

Once prayed to my gods, searching for the whistled memoriesEmpty eyes are staring now, to my feet a land of sorrowI'm the king, sitting in the dark hiding from the shadows of the windWafts of might, wine of fire, I was called to tasteSilver horses brought us here, to the edge of the universeWe left the falling walls as the stars' collapse beganNow I rest on the highest steps, revealed the eternal frontierAs I gaze from the Jewel Throne to the portal of infinityFallen have the "chosen ones", debris remain in the dustFar behind, beyond the sands, the wind sings to those who fellForever now, my hands laid down the poisoned weaponsI will pray to my gods, searching for the mysteries
Thirst and desire, to rule the lightFor crossing heavens, a futile fightBound to storm, our minds waveFervent to sail in deserts of mistJuices like wine, like the blood in the sandsJuices like wineBorn of earth, we strive for skiesObsessed with lies, in arms of sleepEarning dreams, we blind our eyesChallenging secrets, ancient the criesJuices like wine, like the blood in the sandsJuices like wine
You, who like the moon at nightHaunted my mortal heart You who made this ancient wallsShine like divine marbleThe unwanted breath, through credenceA derelict shell in the desertMesmerised As love inflamed the nightBurning tongues brought the rainThe sand remained, purifiedMurmur at the meager's spearBattered Carthaginian prideThe beloved cry, wasted dismayInvasion of baseness and shadeYou, loved by your fatherInnocent as a vestal, doveBuried in a deep blue seaAs we all lose, ever

This evening the moon dreams more lazilyAs some fair woman, lost in cushions deepWith gentle hand caresses listlesslyThe contour of her breasts before she sleepsOn velvet backs of avalanches softShe often lies enraptured as she diesAnd gazes on white visions aloftWhich like a blossoming to heaven riseWhen sometimes on this globe, in indolenceShe lets a secret tear drop down, by chanceA poet, set against oblivionTakes in his hand this pale and furtive tearThis opal drop where rainbow hues appearAnd hides it in his breast far from the sun
[Instrumental]
Heaven carries notWhat the soul would reapGrowth of deceptionLined between the weepsA thousand lusts luring in the heartA desire in our sleep NemesisA million lies striving to be sharedEscaping mindless leapsereosAn afterthought formedFirst among fallen idolsOf the pandemonial stormThe heart beneath, the desire to dieScepters of Scarlet, the eternal lieTormented eyes, perceiving reliefThe shadow's light won't disappearThe mist reveals the shades of griefThe heart beneath, inside my fear
I stalk alone the burried seasDead and white, weak memoriesBelow 0, I'm turning blueWhy does the ice burn so hotFrozen waters, a strange landI know I live, as the frost bitesMy eyes are closed, but I can't sleepMoving forward, for sleep means deathA white shroud covers meI buried myself to stay aliveTime's passing slow on my pale faceBeneath the snow, beneath the iceI stalk alone the burried seasDead and white, weak memories
Burning in a hell made of my ownLooking for the you I once knewYour love is hanging over meLike a big black cloud of miseryOh mother I beg of you to set me freeNow, like the tempting snake of oldShe has seduced my very soulShe took my rib she stole my heartAnd hid it in her bosom's warmthOh mother hallowed be thy nameFor you give birth to us in painMaybe I'm Adam with a paradise lostOr maybe I'm Abel, maybe I'm notBut as sure as hell I know that I'll be chainWasting love and my life againOh woman of sorrow, you guide me oninto caverns, where I do not belongOut of your womb, onto the earthOh mother of my life, please give me birthOh mother of pain, please let me goFor you must reap what you have sownOh mother, my mother yes I knowThe name of my bride is sorrow
Traces of dew, eyes in disbeliefDid we persist in misery and griefTasting a glance of the boldA thousand days of fates untoldAnd from the restless seas I'm bornThrough pain and in the restless seas I drownLove in vainCold embraceRegresses from mankind's traceRuling the light, we gave our lonely heartsAddicted fiends, through weakened weeps and woesThe sight of fear, trading in for faithEternal thirst to lead the circling hateTraces of dew, eyes in disbeliefShattered at base, the lies that we breathe
Lend me your steel-bearing handSo I may reign the Jewel ThroneMy soul feels the gods' demandAs the lost kings uphold my sideBlood and sandMark their wayThe usurper's tearsGuide my swordFantasia slept in my thoughtsAs I was a son of infinityThe emperor, forgotten, rests in my dreamsAs, back to the wall, I start the conquestBlood and sandMark their wayThe usurper's tearsGuide my swordInnocence and wrathNow lie far beyondAs we cross the desertsTo reach the fortress' gatesTragical serenadesAre whispered in the windAs eyes in furyGrant us our strengthThey're throning on the dignity of mightBut the successor is to enter the hallFalse truth saw them climbing the stepsBut I remain the Jewel Throne's choiceBlood and sandMark their wayThe usurper's tearsGuide my sword
Furious the exodus walksAlong the maddening march of deathWith the furor and the massesWhose supremacies is the dominionAlien bodies stiff and coldYour inner sane turns numbYou transform into a rageTo naive to understandAnd as they go on the sacrifice growsWe're living on ground zero fire, this island earthTarget locked, system checked, enter codeWe're living on ground zero fireLocked up in a roomHuman belongs in a cageThe sentence is a scienced deathAs they pull the trigger of ray gunsEvil blackened eyes of youthAbsorbing lifes hidden anguishDeath throw all about the groundOr those who wouldn't fightWe're living on this island earth
Ce soir la Lune reve avec plus de paresseAinsi qu'une beaute sur de nombreux coussinsQui d'une main discrete et legere caresseAvant de s'endormir le contour de ses seinsSur le dos satine, des molles avalanchesMourante elle se livre aux longues pamoisonsEt promene ses yeux sur les visions blanchesQui montent dans l'azur comme des floraisonsQuand parfois sur ce globe en sa longueur oisiveElle laisse filer une larme furtiveUn poete pieu ennemi do sommeilDans le creux de sa main prend cette larme paleAux reflets urizes comme un fragment d'opaleEt l'amener de son corps loin des yeux do Soleil

The face of NemesisUnder pandemonium's heatParched my yearning whisperIn this world of deceitTo lie, to cry, they dieTo drown in their well of sighsAll their pain bears their nameIgnorance dies by its own liesTears of indignationCrying under Apollyon's sunIn faith for loveUnderground, a dream apartFlesh from soilDisparate, no less the sameSift my tearsThe lasting springWe were raised to fadeTo deluge by carnal claimsTo lie, to cry, they dieTo drown in their well of sighs
The face of NemesisUnder pandemonium's heatParched my yearning whisperIn this world of deceit To lie, to cry, they dieTo drown in their well of sighsAll their pain bears their nameIgnorance dies by it's own lies Tears of indignationCrying under Apollyon's sunIn faith for loveUnderground, a dream apart Flesh from soilDisparate, no less the sameSift my tearsThe lasting spring We were raised to fadeTo deluge by carnal claims To lie, to cry, they dieTo drown in their well of sighs
Deep within my bleeding heartStranded by the hold of fearAgony takes a final roleSipping the dew of tearsThorns and rites idols of falseTearing apart the skin of lustForever still but never bornBroken by the final questVanity, silent choir spreading liesVanity, fallen shrine of muted sighsSurrender, dance and cryTheir Tormented eyes perceiveGrasps of fright, lusters crawlTarnished grounds of faded beliefs
My life turns into sandImmortality is my dreamMan shall follow my commandSorcery shall conquer my fearAstral magic and runic wandI feel that wisdom's nearAcross the mountain's iceScarlett at the equinox' dawnI sacrificed an innocent lambAnd drunk the wine of paradiseBut, still run the sands of timeJust one thing yet to be doneAs spell surround meAt a lightmass' nightHe raised the abyssCovered by the swordI sold my soul in veinI feel it, as he returnsThe sands of time will never runFor an immortal dead man
Thousand decades in vain(Again) they strive for final completionForgotten are the fast sinsAnd the perfect creation callsWhat will the wind bring these days?The smell of self-deception?Masses of dullness, a spiral cageAs they ride on visual aggressionOnce, I slept in confidenceSounds like I've been a foolNow, as my will is invisible(They shall) face the evoked curse aloneWhat will the wind bring these days?The smell of self-deception?Masses of dullness, a spiral cageAs they ride on visual aggressionJust fool yourself, a world of ignoranceWill tear the walls, of dreams apartVast signals, memories in blackSense is beyond, distorted any balanceFlood of tears, you'll have to drinkAs the grail, is lying on the floorDon't ask for another messiahNo martyr will save the stupid (again)Is truth what you believe?A prophet's tears will dryWhat will the wind bring these days?The smell of self-deception?Masses of dullness, a spiral cageAs they ride on visual aggressionThe watcher's eyes are closedAs the dust covers the madmen againThere'll be a new kingAnd I was born to encounter himWhat will the wind bring these days?The smell of self-deception?Masses of dullness, a spiral cageAs they ride on visual aggression
They're sleeping through the agesFaces bare of namesRemembrance ever liesAt the Bosom of the insaneDeath's cold embraceAcross the restless seasUnfolding the wish to forgetThe eyes of the deceasedThirst for the wine in my handThird from the sunThe heart of deathA thought for fake desiresStarving trough the nightEngulfed in an earthbound fireLeft all alone among the dances and criesThey seed all the hateWithin the shade of sights

I'm sensing the paleness of liesNo rest to caress their eyesIn visions enthroning sleepA mistress of eternal weepWastelands against the nightBound in chains, a wish for lightWandering beneath my fate my body slowly palesUnleashed, with hands that cannot reachThe screams of heaven and shoresThe sleep - sound of a shadowed searchForesee the wings of solitudeThe wings of solitudeAges of bleeding in vainEntrapped by the whine of the insaneCivilization - a vision of deceitMisfits, emerged from the heatThe violet dances fadeRestless dreams of hate and a silent cryWastelands against the nightBound in chains a wish for lightWandering beneath my fateMy body slowly pales
