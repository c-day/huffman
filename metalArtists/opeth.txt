Losing sleep, in too deepFading sun, what have I doneCame so close to what I need mostNothing left hereCut the ties, uncovered disguiseLeft behind all intertwinedLost control, moved out of the role nowNothing's left hereLeave it beIt was meant for meSoul sacrificeForgot the adviceLost track of timeIn a flurry of smokeWaiting anxietyFor a fair judgement deserved
It was all trueA parlor strode, and the night sets foreverI stray in the quiet coldAnd you gird me when I dare to listenElastic meadow, endless arms of sorrowLips try to form "because"Trying to adapt to the wildernessWhere even foes close their eyes and leaveWe are inside the gladeEvery now and then I wipe the dust asideTo rememberHow I drape my face with my bare handsThe same that brought me hereBut you were beyond all helpThe folded message that wept my nameShadows skulk at my comingWe survey the slopesIn search for the words to write the missing pageThe tainted dogmaTime grows shortAs the piper plays his timeWe are almost thereYou are beyond all helpDancing into the voidWe are almost there
It was me, peering through the looking-glass.Beyond the embrace of Christ.Like the secret face within the tapestry.Like a bird of prey over the crest.And she was swathed in sorrow, as if born within its mask.Her candlelight snuffed, the icon smiled.Emptiness followed by her wake.I could clasp her in undying love.Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine.She faced me in awe. 'twas a token of ebony color.Embodied in faint vapor.Wandering through April's fire.Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you.I will endure, hide away.I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure.It is a mere destiny I thought, a threshold I had crossed before.The rain was waving goodbye, and when the night cameThe forest folded its branches around me.Something passed by, and I went into a dream.She laughing and weeping at once: "take me away".I don't know how or why, I'll never know when.
Cleared the fog that was veiled around meAnd blurred my sightsSuddenly, I'm no longer achingTo honor my plightsRising moon and my skin is peelingPast undoneSuddenly, I can't justifyWhat I had become
Haunted nights for haleyon daysCan't sleep to the scraping of his voiceNature's way struck grief in meAnd I became a ghost in sicknessWillingly guided into heresyBeneath the surface, stark emptinessAnd you'd pity my convictionWhereas I thought of myself as a leaderYou'd cling to your pleasant hopeIt is twisted fascinationWhile I'd ruin the obstacles into despairAnd I'm praising deathLost love of the heartIn a holocaust scene memoryDecrepit body wearing transparent skinInside, the smoke of failureWept for solace and submit to faithIn his shadow I'm chokingYet flourishingMasterA delusion made me strongerYet I'm draped in pale withering fleshI sacrificed more than I hadAnd left my woes beneath the mire

In the name of desperationI call your nameA lamentation I sighAgain and againSpiritual eclipseThe gateways are closed for me to seekThe nightA veil of stars, watchingMy shadow is born from lightThe light of the eye, in darknessOver troubled waters memories soarEndlessly, searching night and dayThe moonlight caresses a lonely hillWith the calmness of a whisperI wear a naked soulA blank face in the streaming waterIt is cold in hereFrost scar my coat with dustEyes attach to your mute portraitWe spoke only through thoughtsTogether we gazed, awaitedHours brought thirst and the rising sunSun birds leave their dark recessesShadows gild the archwaysDo not turn your face towards meConfronting me with my lonelinessYou are in a forest unknownThe secret orchardAnd your voice is vast and achromaticBut still so preciousLullaby of the crescent moon took youMesmerized, its kaleidoscopic faceGranted you a hollow stareAnother soul within the divine herdI have kept itThe amaranth symbolHidden inside the golden shrineUntil we rejoice in the meadowOf the endWhen we both walk the shadowsIt will set ablaze and vanishBlack rose immortalIt is getting dark againDusk shuffle across the fieldsThe evening trees moan as if they knewAt night I always dream of you

BeatingHeart still beating for the causeFeedingSoul still feeding on the lossAchingLimbs are aching from the rushFadingYou are fading from my sightBreak of morning, coldness lingers onShroud me into nightmares of the sunMovingI am moving closer to your sideLuringYou are luring me into the nightCryingWho is crying for you hereDyingI am dying fast inside your tearsPlunging towards bereavement faster yetClearing thoughts, my mind is setDevious movements in your eyesMoved me from reliefBreath comes out white clouds with your liesAnd filters through meYou're close to the final wordYou're staring right past me in dismayA liquid seeps from your chestAnd drains me awayMist ripples round your thin white neckAnd draws me a lineCold fingers mark this dying wreckThis moment is mineHelp me cure youAtone for all you've doneHelp me leave youAs all the days are doneNight falls againTaking what's left of meSlight twist, shivering corpseOrnated with water, fills the cracksClasped in my limbs by traditionThis is all you need
The sun don't shineThe moon don't move the tidesTo wash me clean The sun don't shineThe moon don't move the tidesTo wash me clean Why so unforgiving and why so cold?Been a long time crossingThe bridge of sighs Cold wind blowsAnd the Gods look down in angerOn this poor child Cold wind blowsThe Gods look down in angerOn this poor child Why so unforgiving and why so cold?Been a long time crossingBridge of sighs
I once upon a timeCarried a burden insideSome will ask goodbyeA broken line but underlinedThere's an ocean of sorrow in youSorrow in meSaw movement in their eyesSaid I no longer knew the wayGiven up the ghostA passing minds and its a fearAnd the wait for redemption aheadWaiting to fadeFading againIf death should take me nowCount my mistakes and let me throughWhisper in my earTaken more than we've receivedAnd the ocean of sorrow is you
Let me tasteLet me feelI need to know what you keep insideNo need to speakJust let it beCarry out this wish for me let nothing interfereRise to submissionI'm still beneath in the soilDiscard your clothesLet loose your hairWe're intertwined forever and has always beenSay the wordAnd I'll departUpon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my causeAnd so comes the darkVibrant as ever beforeFlowers already witheredIn this endless winter of soulsOutside in the parkThe days move alongAnd nothing ever changesThey have nothing on usBut we've always knewThat nothing ever changesRise to submissionI'm still beneath in the soilThis is ours aloneFeeding off the warmthLured out from the insideDepending on the life bloodSilentlyWhisperingMove in me and set me free
After the battle is overAnd the sands drunken the bloodAll what there remainsIs the bitterness of delusionThe immortality of the godsSits at their sideAs they leave the walls behindTo reach the jewels gleamThe days have comeWhen the steel will ruleAnd upon his headA crown of goldYour hand wields the mightThe tyrant's the precursorYou carry the willAs the morning is nearI sing the balladsOf victory and defeatI hear the talesOf frozen mysteryThe new kingdoms riseBy the circle of the tyrantsIn the land of darknessThe warrior, That was meGrotesque gloryNone will ever see them fallAnd hunts and warAre like everlasting shadowsWhere the winds cannot reachThe tyrant's might was bornAnd often I look backWith tears in my eyesGrotesque gloryNone will ever see them fallAnd hunts and wars

Heal myself, a feather on my heartLook inside, there never was a startPeel myself, dispose of severed skinAll subsides, around me and withinThere's nothing painful in thisThere's no upheavalRedemption for my pathosAll sins undoneAwaiting word on what's to comeIn helpless prayers a hope lives onAs I've come clean I've forgotten what I promisedIn the rays of the sun I am longing for the darkness
She told me whyShe told me liesI always take care of thisI told her howI've always stayedAlways waited for nothingWhen I get out of hereWill I leave you behind?I found that the years passed despiteWhen I get out of hereWill I leave you behind?I found that the years passed despiteAnd I can see youRunning through the fields of sorrowYes I can see youRunning through the fields of sorrowWhen you get out of hereWhen you leave me behindYou find that the years passed us byWhen you get out of hereWhen you leave me behindYou find that those years passed us byAnd I can see youRunning through the fields of sorrowYes I can see youRunning through the fields of sorrow
Deserted again.You speak to me through the shadows.Walking in closed rooms, using cold words.Captured by the night.The yearning escapes from my embrace.Strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts, scream your sadness.And they all turned away, unable to face more of this death.Credence in my word.Written in dust, tainted by memories.I confess my hope, recognize my loneliness.Your laughter weeps the truth.Push me into corners.Confirming the epitaph of my soulAnd displaying the once unknown karma.
Out on the road there are fireflies circlingDeep in the woods, where the lost souls hideOver the hill there are men returningTrying to find some peace of mindSleep my childUnder the fog there are shadows movingDon't be afraid, hold my handInto the dark, there are eyelids closingBuried alive in the shifting sandsSleep my childSpeak to me now and the world will crumbleOpen a door and the moon will fallAll of your life, all your memoriesGo to your dreams, forget it allSleep my child
Floating on mistCrept up the caverns of my brainReceived no warningFrom nothing to a life codeWalk with me, you'll never leaveWait to see your spirit freeTell me how your heart's in needAs I drown you in the seaUnwinding snares of distrustYour wrist in my fast gripLook me in the eye, I'm clearThis is your timeFace down beneath the waterlineGazing into the deepFrom love to deathIn a time span of secondsOblivious to regretPushed into beliefIn liquid cellophaneGasping for airMercy in my eyesIs the shade of the nightThe piercing sounds you makeSoaring higher, higher nowAnd once left in my wakeYour memory's nothing but the scars on meAll over nowForgotten why I needed thisStanding downDisappear into the obscureResting daysWaiting for new diseaseBiding timeLocked inside insanityIt always burns withinThe downward spiral never endsWhen driven into sinYour salvation's found in a sinners deedThe devil guides the wayTells me what to sayPours himself insideAnd snuffs the final lightDeliveranceThrown back at meDeliveranceLaughing at me
Silent dance with death.Everything is lost.Torn by the arrival of Autumn.The blink of an eye, you know it's me.You keep the dagger close at hand.And you saw nothing.False love turned to pure hate.The wind cried a lamentation,before merging with the grey.Demon of the fall.Gasping for another breath.She rose, screaming at closed doors.Seductive faint mist forgingthrough the cracks in the wall.I shan't resist.In tears for all of eternity.She turned around and faced me for the first time.Run away, run away.Just one second, and I was left with nothing.Her fragrance still pulsating through damp air.That day came to an end.And she had lost in me, her credence.
Someone died for looking too farWhile I was asleep in my houseA child was killed, I heard it from a friendA war raged in a distant landCost me to linger on a piece of text Someone diedNot here, never here There was a feverThere is a failureAre you a believer?That someone lied to you You hold it closer to your chestThere was a meaning for this testBut you forgot and it's gone nowYou were controlled somehow There was a mean timeAn invitation of sortsI remember lifeI, I was sick with sorrow I'd fallen asleepAnd dreamt of my sins hereIt was your turnAdamant smile and said, "Thank you" There was a sickness right in the familyWhile I shuddered in the coldWoman hanged for her sins while I craved mineAn old man drowned in this life herdAs I made amends with my fathers Someone diedNot here, never here
Lost, here is nowhereSearching home stillTurning past me, all are goneTime is nowThe omen showed, took me awayPreparations are done, this can't lastThe mere reflection brought disgustNo ordeal to conquer, this firm slitIt sheds upon the floor, dripping into a poolGrant me sleep, take me underLike the wings of a dove, folding aroundI fade into this tender care
[Instrutmental]
There it was.The final destiny.A sunrise that never came,Still the night lamp that never faded away.Farewell was the word,And the afterglow was the brave morning.Rising and telling everyoneAbout the beauty of its prologue.
By the turnstile beckons a damsel fairThe face of Melinda neath blackened hairNo joy would flicker in her eyesBrooding sadness came to a rise Words would falter to atoneFailure had passed the stepping stoneShe had sworn her vows to anotherThis is when no-one will bother And conceded pain in crumbling mirthA harlot of God upon the earthFound where she sacrificed her waysThat hollow love in her face Still I plotted to have her backThe contentment that would fill the crackMy soul released a fluttering sighThis day fell, the darkness nigh I took her by the hand to sayAll faith forever has been washed awayI returned for you in great dismayCome with me, far away to stay Endlessly gazing in nocturnal primeShe spoke of her vices and broke the rhymeBut baffled herself with the final lineMy promise is made but my heart is thine
I can't see your faceAnd I can't breathe your airSo I wonder why I get cold insideWhen I hear your nameWhen we meet eye to eyeI will ask how and whyAnd when guilt has its wayOne lesser reason to stayAnd I will see her cryInto the fire of our youth comes the devil againAnd you feel your way, feel your waySaw you standing nighIn the cornerTold me that you had diedAnd I would die when my heart was emptyBecome a ghost in perpetual voidAnd neglect all reasons why
Hey you, will you be trueWhen you can see through what I doFeel the pain in your brain, insaneWill I see my name in your scarsAnd you will see what you mean to meLast between the linesDo you feel the needWhen the night comes downAnd when the night comes downA father is waitingAnd you will see what you mean to meLost control and called your nameLeft a home in the pouring rainIn a sea of guilt and shameWill we sustain
[Instrumental]
The memories that now rests in this forestForever shadowing the sunrise of my heartWings leave their nest at my comingSwaying away unto the cold glowing sky Dreaming away for a whileMy spirit sighs in peaceGazing unto the starsPlease, take me there I am so alone, so coldMy heart is to scarred to glowI wish the sunrise to comeTake my soul (away)From this cold, lonely shellI am free From the eternal sea I roseVeiled in darkness on either shoreLost my pride, lost its glowFor me the sun rose no more The forest of OctoberSleeps silent when I departThe web of timeHides my last trace My blaze travel the last universeLike the sights of magicWrapped in eonsMy mind is one with my soulI fall aloneWhile leaves fall from the weeping trees
Ghost of MotherLingering deathGhost on Mother's bedBlack strands on the pillowContour of her healthTwisted face upon the headGhost of perditionStuck in her chestA warning no one readTragic friendshipCalled inside the fogPouring venom brew deceivingDevil cracked the earthly shellForetold she was the oneBlew hope into the room and said:"You have to live before you die young"Holding her downChanneling darknessHemlock for the GodsFading resistanceDraining the weaknessPenetrating inner lightRoad into the dark unawareWinding ever higherDarkness by her sideSpoke and passed her byDedicated hunterWaits to pull us underRose up to it's callIn his arms she'd fallMother light receivedAnd a faithful servant's freeIn time the hissing of her sanityFaded out her voice and soiled her nameAnd like marked pages in a diaryEverything seemed clean that is unstainedThe incoherent talk of ordinary daysWhy would we really need to live?Decide what is clear and what's within a hazeWhat you should take and what to giveGhost of perditionA saint's premonition's unclearKeeper of holy hoardsKeeper of holy whoresTo see a beloved sonIn despair of what's to comeIf one cut the source of the flowAnd everything would changeWould conviction fallIn the shadow of the righteousThe phantasm of your mindMight be calling you to goDefying the forgotten moralsWhere the victim is the prey

Stay with me a whileRise above the vileName my final restPored into my chestChorus:Into the orchard I walk, peering way past the gateWilted scenes for us who couldn't waitDrained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows aheadHalo of death, all I see is departureMourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyrPledge yourself to meNever leave me beSweat breaks on my browGiven time ends nowChorusSpirit painted sinEmbers 'neath my skinVeiled in pale embraceReached and touched my faceChorus
A lifeline in a drop of bloodA dying wish shun a GodSought a dream inside the lightFinally relieved from plightO this night is deceivingOne eternal WinterEarth below and reelingMoon is riding highFather and a liarOne forgotten seasonSecrets in the mireMoor is riding highAligningA name inside a memoryWaiting for youWhen words can't win herThere is nothing to doSave your childrenDrenched in povertyTracks in the snowLeading them to woe
Long daysSlow wasteSew liesSow hate So many years to clean the slateEndless despair within it's wakeHis touch soiling what used to be cleanHis gaze burning on the edge of our dreams No moreCold paceSlow days (?) And again he rides inIt's September and he covets the gullibleSkeletal wish - hunterA thousand liesCast from the throne of secrecy Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable liesSee the twisted hand of doubt seal the affairThe insect trust - believerYour body a vehicle to Pearls before swine they are nothing but blindSubmit to nothing and swallow my spit of scornInvisible king - dyingProcession of woe, struck down by sorrow A burden so greatWeighs heavy on old and withered beliefsThe swift solution crumblesBeneath the mock notes of a masterpieceDeath in his eyes - waitingSpiraling judgment, provoked in the rains This futile test drowned in the levee of deception In the year of his sovereignRid us of your judgmentHeir apparent

Will their children cryWhen their mother diesAnd in the autumn of their livesWill they feel the same?[reversed lyrics 2:03-2:22]The longing for meComin' down like hailWhy did you leave me?Come here insideAnd tell me howHow in my final daysYou found aroundYour concernThe signal for us to end our livesTo wipe beneath the watchesAnd you wait foreverThe night comes highYour weaknessStoring trace on your eyesSo I left you aloneWe all left you alone[reversed lyrics 7:21-7:24]Lock the children away from harmThey'll lock all your reason whySeeking (?) with a daggerSkin is blocked by the years of trialYou felt abandoned in the fog of fleshSitting in place from the deadAwaiting the face of the moon to ascendYou follow the siren in your headIn your head
Two yearsIn your heartOne moment of doubtTwo livesTorn apartOne second from nowHeld himIn your armsYour fever subsideAlways safe from harmKept demons insideStill you always start runnin'Touch the lightFrom the moonSome way mother criedLeft us space here
In the corner beside my windowHangs a lonely photographThere is a reason I never notice itMemory that could hold me backThere is a wound that's always bleedingThere is a road I'm always walkingAnd I know you'll never return to this placeGone through days without talking There is a comfort in silence So used to losing all ambition And struggling to maintain what's leftThere is a wound that's always bleeding There is a road I'm always walking And I know you'll never return to this place Once undone, there's only smoke Burning in my eyes to blind To cover up what really happened And force the darkness unto meThere is a wound that's always bleeding There is a road I'm always walking And I know you'll never return to this place
Found a way to rid myself clean of painAnd the fever that's been haunting meHas gone awayLooking through my windowI seem to recognizeAll the people passing byBut I am aloneAnd far from homeAnd nobody knows meNever heard me say goodbyeNever shall I speak to anyone againAll days are in darknessAnd I'm biding my timeOnce I am sure of my task I will rise again
I feel the dark when I see youI feel the dark when I see youLoosen the harness of trustSurvey an impulse of lustThe thespian is far awayUprooted yet forced to staySing a lie, ghost of the nightGive yourself to meThe road is long and winding stillAnd these bonds will stay to frayBut another dayA flaking wish insideVeiled comes the daylight through the glassIn the never-ending rainThis is no friend of mineStalking the comfort withinA flaking wish insideThe mother of liesAnd you're going out to warWhen the beast is coming homeAnd the sun is seen no moreFor the devil's love you boreI feel the dark when I see you
Seven milestones...Under a watching autumn eyeContorted trees are spreading forthThe message of the wind With frozen hands I rode with the stars With anger the wind blewGiving wings to my stallionClouds gathered across the moonBlazing the white light Passing the lake I know so wellI am near, yet so far away Arrival...I saw her shadow (standing) in the darknessAwaiting me like the nightAwaits the dayStanding silent smiling at my presenceA black candle holds the only light Darkness enclosesAnd the candle seem to expireIn her cold, cold handAnd as a forlorn soulIt will fade away Touching her flesh in this nightMy blood froze foreverEmbraced before the dawnA kiss brought total eclipse And she spokeOnce and foreverI am so coldIn mist enrobed the twilightShe was standing...

I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leadingI try to forget you as you forgot meThis time there is nothing left for you to takeThis is goodbyeSummer is miles and miles awayAnd no one would ask me to stayAnd I should contemplate this changeTo ease the painAnd I should step out of the rainTurn awayClose to ending it all, I am drifting through thestagesOf the rapture born within this lossThoughts of death insideTear me apart from the core of my soulSummer is miles and miles awayAnd no one would ask me to stayAnd I should contemplate this changeTo ease the painAnd I should step out of the rainTurn awayAt times the dark's fading slowlyBut it never sustainsWould someone watch over meIn my time of need?Summer is miles and miles awayAnd no one would ask me to stayAnd I should contemplate this changeTo ease the painAnd I should step out of the rainTurn away
There's a sense of longing in meAs I read Rosemary's letterHer writing's honestCan't forget the years she's lostIn isolationShe talks about her loveAnd as I read"I'll die alone"I know she was achingThere's a certain detail seen hereThe pen must have slipped to the sideAnd left a stainNext to his nameShe knew he was goneAnd isolationIs all that would remain"The wound in me is pouring outTo rest on a lover's shore"
And as they say, grief is only able to possess.The rotting body clad in ancient clothesIs left behind with a wave of the hand.I have gone away. The bed is cold and empty.Trees bend their boughs toward the earth.And nighttime birds float as black faces.It was the hand reaching out through the mirror.Unknown and scarred by life...The luring eyes, you had never seen.You have nothing more to find.You have nothing more to loose.The cold season drifts over the land.They huddle in the brown corners.Some would settle for less.The castles were all empty, asleep.Long awaiting their king.Beckoning round the bend.Amidst the forest one would hear that I had been there.Draped within a fate I could not change,And always welcoming Winter's EPILOGUE.
Our abode 'mongst the stars is waiting,Long enough for our last breath of life.You stare at nothing, right through me,At times resembling the Devil's concubine.And me, I am the idol that would longTo caress our eyes until they would open no more.I would comfort you if I only could,But as we all know by now... I am just thin air.Unaware as you are of my presence,You are losing yourself.Hiding within the Amen Corner
There is a voice calling for meThere is a light coming down on meThere is a doubt that is clearingThere is a day that is dawningThere is a wound that is healingThere is a season waiting for meThere is a road that is turningThere is a fire still burningA sickness in meConstant pace towards the endThe need is strongerThis time the need is deeperThere is a peace I am searchingThere is a freedom I'm depending onThere is a pain that's never endingThere is a rain falling only on meThere is a dream I am livingThere is a life I'm dreaming ofThere is a death I'm awaitingThere is a home I am desertingI hold my breath in waitOnly moments remainMovement for departed hopeEffect for absent friendsSever the faith from my bodyLeave me begging for moreTake what I have and deliver meInto everlasting sleepSoothing tranceColours fadeAnd disappearEthereal lightShowing me what I can do withoutIn a motionless sceneThere is only meI take what I canControlling you to get aheadFading awayAnd leavingLong for sleepCloser nowLead the way into deathEvery wretched dreamI've left behindEvery waking hourI lie in waitSucked inside by willGone into the floodAll my questions unfurledAs I was put to the testOnce I'm below there's no turning backPlunging into the deepest void Departed shell left drained behind Pacing roads unknownSearching for a new homeDesert in my eyeBarren lands inside
I lost all I hadI turned to my friendsI wrote down a nameI wallowed in shame I said that I loveI cling to my pastI promise to stayI went far away Icy roads beneath my feetLead me through wastelands of deceitRest your head now, don't you cryDon't ever ask the reason why Kept inside a idle raceGhosts of an idol's false embraceRest your head now, don't you cryDon't ever ask the reason why
Kept warm by the light of the lanternLost sight of everything tonightMy presence blackens their patternA pock in the healthy and calm Their scorn behind your backMy promise would put them downNo trace of reverence leftImmemorial fire in their eyes I would perish at the given signalAt the slightest touch from my soulTainted prophet in fleshFor all the plagued and lost Dripping sinDecision in stalemateDare to feel death at handSurprised me with its voiceThrough the forest came the morn Across the leafy pathwayTheir deeds smeared in bloodFor all to beholdThe council of the crossMust have sensed my comingThe pest through the airWith despise for squalorLashing out at the poor I turned away my eyesIn pallor escape from the endFading time to leave from hereAnd less to fulfill my taskShe would be safe and firmNothing of this is in vainTaken away from stifling graceAnd saved from the past
I arose from the lullabyEnduring yet another taleYou tempt me againWith your embrace, so taintedWithin the night you beckonCursing me with every glanceBring me throughCarry my empty shadowAnd guide me inside your warped labyrinthTo the well of sinI swear I will always love youLeave me speechlessRelease my yearningThe soil I walk is clad with lightDrifting moons thrust me with their raysAnd I fall insideI lament this heritageCannot bid farewellThe pale face you went as far as you couldAnd from that momentI witnessed your beauty, felt your deathMine is yours, mine is yoursIn the wake of dawnThe mist of morning linger before it leavesInvisible eyes, red reflectionIt is youSmiling in the midst of the moor
Hope would fail me in the falling snowAnd slake a wish insideFriends would leave me in my darkest hourYet trust me with their livesShe would haunt my dreams and feed my demonsThey tell me to go

A morning in magenta, the petals fed from the dew. She held her breath for a moment, to pause off the stream. Still clinging to vast, old memories. And I would marvel at her beauty, playing through the rain. The coffin is beautifully engraved. Stained by soil, symbols of death. All of which are stared upon, with porcelain eyes it seems. Some spoke, and it was my turn to go. In death entwined, I could not believe. But it hangs around my neck. A soft breeze passed me by, somewhat warmer for a second. I knew it was the coming of spring, thus our >April Etheral<
Follow the embers into cities of dreamsWhat you'll be seeing is not all what it seemsDawn of the liarFuture's a pyre Outside the window I see people passing byIf they could see me now they'd break down and cry Look down your sensesAwait the gritting beyondAnd in the morning...  Born as a failureAnd died as a stranger When your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn Outside the window I see people passing byIf they could see me now they'd break down and cry "Bring me back again"
Unchain the colours before my eyes,Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,I shall return from out of fire.Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,Flickers above us, to light up the sky.Unchain the colours before my eyes,Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,I shall return from out of fire.

Into the trees past meadow groundsAnd further away from my homeBaying behind me I hear the houndsFlock's chasing to find me aloneA trail of sickness leading to meIf I am haunted then you will seeSearching the darkness and emptinessI'm hiding away from the sunWill never rest, will never be at easeAll my matter's expired so I runA trail of sickness leading to meIf I am haunted then you will seeThere falls anotherVapor hands released the bladeInsane regrets at the dropInstruments of death before meLose all to save a little at your peril, it's justifiedAnd dismiss your demons as death becomes a jestYou are the laughing stock of the absinthe-mindedConfession stuck in your mouth and long-gone fevers reappearNocturnally helpless, weak in the lightDepending on a prayerPacing deserted roads to find a seed of hopeThey are the treesRotten pulp inside, never wellRoots are sucking, thieving from my sourceTired boughs reaching for the lightIt is all false pretension, harlequin forestAwaiting redemption for a lifetimeAs they die alone with no one by their sideAre they forgiven?Stark determinationPoisoning the soulUnfettered beast insideChiming sovereign controlAnd now the woods are burningTearing life-crops asunderUseless blackened remainsStill pure smoldering
Returned from a hibernal dreamVoices fell like marbleNo longer by my sideGone all that would linger Ripped from my embraceMelinda reflected in shaftsRed line round her neckMet the earth in silence White faced, haggard grinThis serenity painted deathWith a halo of bitter diseaseBlack paragon in lingering breath Saw here fading, blank stare into meClenched fist from the beautiful pain Darkness reared its headTearing within the reeling hazeTook control, claiming my fleshPiercing rage, perfect tantrumEach and every one would die at my handChoking in warm ponds of bloodAt last, weak and torn, I went downDrained from strength, flickering breath Came with the moonThe wayward in conscious stateFlanked and barred in destiny's endUnderneath with hope in lachesSwathed in filth, any would betokenStarlit shadows on the wallFinally there to collect meFrom the bowels of sin
[Instrumental]
Summer's gone and love has witheredI believe in nothing yet nothing is what it seemsAll is gone and promises slitheredYou have me nothing yet nothing is what it seemsSummer is goneYour eyes gave away all your lies in the endThe dawning of a seething designKept a secret from the lightAnd felt the weight on my shoulders increaseA bleeding heart led my desperationLike a bird on a wireA broken promise of dedicationNever ever again
There is a light that hits the gloom aroundShows the footprints round this graveDried up roses scattered on the moundHonoring the one engravedWill ever the morningCarry awayThe souls of those for whom we cry?Leaving, grievingSeeking, meetingBinding, unwindingSighing "You"Still day beneath the sunAsking you who is the oneAnd when the day is lateWe know who must forever waitBlack procession through the narrow aislesAnother's gone for all to seeNear the site for one who lost his trialsSleeping 'neath the ground is meWill ever the morningCarry awayThe souls of those for whom we cry?Leaving, grievingSeeking, meetingBinding, unwindingSighing "You"Still day beneath the sunAsking you who is the oneAnd when the day is lateWe know who must forever wait
White summer.So far I have gone to see you again.Hiding your face in the palm of your hands.Finding solace in the words I do despise.You snatch at every sound.And even though you believe that I am shackled within death,Memories are tainted with paleness.Crestfallen still.Those eyes, empty like a barren well.It was the only task I would undertake.To reap the harvest that was mine.The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow,And left me helpless in your embrace.The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing,Now slowly smoldering to dust.The celestial touch, from grey to black.A fathomless void enclosing.Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs.I can not endure. And so I rose from my sleep.The moon turned away its face.Overture of the long, black night beginsSomething you said: "Eerie circles upon the waters".Until now we have shared the same aura.My ashes within your hands.My breath in the sepulchral mound.You know that your night is my day.The final spark that blew life into me,The demon of the fall.
In solitude I wanderThrough the vast enchanted forest The surrounding skies are oneTorn apart by the phenomenon of lightningRain is pouring down my (now) shivering shouldersIn the rain my tears are forever lost The darkened oaks are my only shelterRed leaves are blown by the windAn ebony raven now catches my eyeSitting in calmnessBefore spreading his black wingsReaching for the skies In this forestWhere wolves cry their agony unto the moonMy spirit is hiddenIn the form of wisdomCarved on a black stoneThe only way to follow Open your soulRedeem, I am immortal Blinded by a lightMy soul is held up in gloryI engulf the skiesThe apostle in triumph Through the eternal flame I travelAs the rain keeps falling
I hear the baying of the houndsIn the distance, I hear them devouringPest ridden jackals of the earthDiabolical beasts and roaming the forestsIn wait and constant protectorsCalling you to sit by his sideYour self loathing image in his fleshA revelation upon which you lingerHis words are fliesSwarming towards the true insectsFeasting on buried dreamsAnd spreading decay upon your skinHis eyes spew forth a darknessThat cut through and paralyzeCasts light upon your secretsForced to confront your enemiesHis mouth is a vortexSucking you into it's pandemoniumFools you with a helping hand of ashesReached out in false dismayHis body is a countryThe cities lay dead and beyond despairFriends turned enemies unable to come cleanIn a rising fog of reeking deathEverything you believed is a lieEveryone you loved is a death burdenSo you take comfort in himAnd you are receptive to stark wishesNo longer struggling to declare your standYou would inflict no harm to othersThey are unaware of youAnd in a loop of futile eventsYou are everything, they are nothingDrown in the deep mireWith past desiresBeneath the mireDrown desire now with youLined up verses on dead skin"The tainted lips of the strangerResting upon hers"And I embrace bereavementEverything beloved is shattered anywayI would devote myself to anyoneI would accept any flawsI am too weak to resistTension vibrating with horrorFinding the outcast in my eyesPushing nerves on a puppetEndless poison in my veinsClean intent now tainted with deathAnd so, cold touch now inhumaneEvery waking hourAwaiting a reverie to unfoldAnd now they are calling meLouder by the minuteThe baying of the houndsCalling me back to my home

Please remedy my confusionAnd thrust me back to the dayThe silence of your seclusionBrings night into all you sayPull me down againAnd guide me into painI'm counting nocturnal hoursDrowned visions in haunted sleepFaint flickering of your powersLeaks out to show what you keepPull me down againAnd guide me intoThere is failure insideThis test I can't persistKept back by the enigmaNo criterias demanded hereDeadly patterns made my wreathProsperous in your waysPale ghost in the cornerPouring a caress on your shoulderPuzzled by shrewd innocenceRuns a thick tide beneathUshered into inner gravesNails bleeding from the struggleIt is the end for the weak at heartAlways the sameA lullaby for the ones who've lost allReeling insideMy gleaming eye in your necklace reflectsStare of primal regretsYou turn your back and you walk awayNever againSpiralling to the ground belowLike Autumn leaves left in the wake to fade awayWaking up to your sound againAnd lapse into the ways of misery
You wait by the windowMorning's breath on the sillIdle hands given another trySo you wait and you savour the momentOutside the canvas turned whiteRuby eyes in the fogRain washing clean all the sinsA liquid gown that covers allYour loathe turns endlessOpened mirage sooths your senseLocked on the pinnacleThe best secret withinLike a derelict childHeart burning for a strangerAscending to the meekFlock round the liars in aweCaked in the soil beneathFear me when we meetTurn away in admirationMy firm grip round the nucleus of joyEnough of thisYou will leave me nowYou will see it nowPerish at my handsClose to youTangled up in hairFresh stigma looksShall I take you with meAnd it is coldRuby eyes in the fogIt is meAnd you are just like them allStained by the name of fathersI'm greeting my downward fallLeaving the throes to others

Liquid is in your throatFor hopeless delightAfter all you fell in love with deathLife has abortedAll you've had and all you becameThe night is calling, you pray forthA barren waste is your landCrops they were sown to dieThis skin is a mirrorThe eyes hover with ignoranceHell throb from your lipsSucked in and safe from the world of sleepAll years caring for a liarThe barren drift road is winding higherYou're a moth too close to the fireYou are stuck in a beautiful futureChanging and waiting and seeking the truth of it allFleeting in sorrowPushing your spirit awaySeeking the weakness of dislikeWhispered from the heartTo be, we're all in the mourningTo despair[?] Cries out: "The restless will also... die."Resurrection covered with deathDrawing the life under oneA fact tied to the earthThe soul's a victim, a followerOh, mother![Incoherent growling]For us to seeThe blink of an eyeAnd the pride of a motherDrawn close in a mother's sonAnd the love from a fatherWas used by a father's sonOver warrior's tokenMisspoken lives onThe language unimportantSo fair and so justAll the land is taken

And so you left usJaded and gaunt, some SeptemberWilted with the seasonsBut hidden inside the delusionI saw you eyes, somewhereDevoid of deathThe aura poises amidst (the storm)In solid tears I lingerA parlor glade, moonlit sorrowLonely resting poolsRelics of the moon-dogged lakeWhisper: "All your words are miss given"Am I like them?Those who mourn and turn awayThose who would give anythingTo see you againIf only for another secondYour face was, like the photographPainted whiteWe did not speak very often about itWhat does it matter now?Cloak of autumn shroudI gaze, dim ricochet of starsI reckon it is time for me to leaveYou sleep in the lightYet the night and the silent waterStill so dark...
Unto you I whisperThe wildest dreams In the coldness of night Shrouded in crystalsThrough a frosty duskSouls of the full moon awaitsTheir shadows ablaze We are all bendingOur tired leaves over your empty shellIn the sign of true esteemAre you beloved lordSighing deep under these waterfalls? The birds of the sunSeparates these dark cloudsWhile the winds of winter sleeps gently aroundI am sworn to the oathTo breathe... At the waters I dwellThe waves are still whisperingAncient lullabiesI die While our mystic brothers still seek Under your command I will obeyIn my visionYou are the embodiment of pure freedomBut through my eyes you are made of stone

There's nobody here, there's nobody nearI try not to care, dead eyes always stareLet these matters be, don't trust what you seeTake hold of your time, step into the lineThere's innocence torn from its makerStillborn, the trust in youThis failure has made the creatorSo would you tell him what to do? Would you?Leave your mark upon the head of someoneWho'll cry for his state, we know it's too lateI turn round to see what was meant to beFaint movement release to rid the diseaseThere's innocence torn from its makerStillborn, the trust in youI have lost all trust I had in youThis failure has made the creatorSo would you tell him what to do?I have lost all trust I had in you
Once again I've criedUnto the moonThat burning flameThat has guided meThrough all these years The lake from which you flow With eyes of fireOnce unlit but now aliveThis energy, sparklingLike a morning star The morning star Riding the fires ofThe northern goldI've searched the eyeI laugh under the weeping moon I am the watcher in the skiesNor the emeralds know my markGlisten to mark their presenceSet the enigma ablazeSearchingFindingBurn the winter landmarksThat said I was thereBurn the spirit of coldThat travel through my soul
Found you there in the blink of an eyeI miss youTurned away into a thousand dreamsFound out what they meanLost you there in a moment of truthI trust youGave away the one and only heartA gift to tear apartStain me, save meTake me to my homeHold me, show meTake me to my homeWeaker now, drawing fluid from meYou kill meI'm not afraid of what you have just doneBut of what you've just become
Red sun rising somewhere through the dense fog.The portrait of the jaded dawn who had seen it all before.This day wept on my shoulders.Still the same as yesterday.This path seems endless, body is numb.The soul has lost its flame.Walking in familiar traces to find my way back home.So there I was.Within the sobriety of the immortals.A semblance of supernatural winds passing through.The garden sighs, flowers die.The gate was closed that day, but I was bound to carry on.She could not see me through the windows.In dismay, strangest twist upon her lips.Graven face, she said my name.Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour.The gilded faces grin, aware of my final demise.And I cried, I knew she had lied.Her obsession had died, it had died.When can I take you from this place?When is the word but a sigh?When is death our lone beholder?When do we walk the final steps?When can we scream instead of whisper?When is the new beginning,The end of this sad Madrigal.

Blank face in the windowpaneMade clear in seconds of lightDisappears and returns againCounting hours, searching the nightMight be waiting for someoneMight be there for us to seeMight be in need of talkingMight be staring directly at meInside plays a lullabySlurred voice over children criesOn the insideHaunting loneliness in the eyeSkin covering a secret scarHis hand is waving a goodbyeThere's no response or action returnedThere is deep prejudice in meOutshines all reason insideGiven dreams all ridden with painAnd projected unto the last
Falling inside againThis nightmare always the sameStill never enoughHalting at the brink of discoveryMoving into the darknessLeaking inside to cover upDragging me down and underEntangled and undone at once Old memoriesI'm not in need but wish to knowWhat are the tragedies The history behind the wallsPacing further downFamiliar children's laughterDissonant and out of timeAnd they're eyes are deadWatching myself in a pool of waterWearing the mask of a ghostSmeared all across my skinRotten earth and insectsEndless nightAlways preserving the calmMovement behindBleeding animals in a field of fireThere is no absolutionDeath is but a fairytaleThey are mere visionsThey are afraid of meClear insightA smoke is rising nearbyDust covering my coatBlend together to spell my namePale, covered me with sweatThere are no words leftSole provider of deathDistorted faith in myselfHuman harvest burningBlackest pages turningTwisted perception come trueCaptured in dreams connectedStaring right backSpiritual decay - Still seekingFrozen in timeMourn this departure - All watchingCalling me backClosure to bleak matters- I'm leavingEnd of a searchComing of morningCalling me backClosure to bleak matters- I'm leavingEnd of a searchComing of morning - Returning
