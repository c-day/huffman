(glover) Behind the smile is great and nice,Beware of what is in his eyes.Looks like fun but he's after you,It's not so funny what that smile can do... Behind the smile there lies a face,Filled with cunning but is full of grace.Comes on friendly but is deadly too,Beware for he'll take care of you... An innocent soul well it hurtsI'm so nieve, that's all you ever see Behind the smile you cannot seeLies another fool in miseryDon't be fooled by that friendly grinThe jaws of death are going to draw you in... Call you in...

The sky is red, I don't understand, Past midnight I still see the land People are sayin' the woman is damned, She makes you burn with a wave of her hand. The city's a blaze, the town's on fire. The woman's flames are reaching higher. We were fools, we called her liar. All I hear is "Burn!" I didn't believe she was devil's sperm. She said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn! When I leave there's no return." The people laughed till she said, "Burn!" Warning came, no one cared. Earth was shakin', we stood and stared. When it came no one was spared. Still I hear "Burn!" You know we had no time, We could not even try. You know we had no time. You know we had no time, We could not even try. You know we had no time. The sky is red, I don't understand, Past midnight I still see the land. People are sayin' the woman is damned, She makes you burn with a wave of her hand. Warning came, no one cared. Earth was shakin', we stood and stared. When it came no one was spared. Still I hear "Burn!"

As I stand at the crossroad,I see the sun sinking lowWith my cross of indecision,I can't tell which way to goNow I have seen the seven wondersAnd I have sailed the seven seas,I've walked and talked with angels,And danced all night with gypsy queensAll in all it's been a rocky road,Twists and turns along the wayBut, I still pray for tomorrow,All my hopes, my dreamsDon't fade away Don't fade awayI have painted many portraits,Memories of love and pain,Though cut down by life's deceptionsI found the strength to start againAll in all it's been a rocky road,Twists and turns along the wayBut, I still pray for tomorrow,All my hopes, my dreamsDon't fade awayDon't fade away. Heaven help a manTrying to make up his mind,With the darkness closing in,I feel I'm running out of timeShine a light for me,Help me find the way to go,And take me where I've never been beforeAnd so I stand at the crossroad,Watching the sun sinking lowWith my cross of indecision,Trying to find the way to goAll in all it's been a rocky road,Twists and turns along the way,But, I still pray for tomorrowAll my hopes, my dreamsDon't fade away
