Girl I'm like an animalLocked up in a cageYou know I'd do anything to see youHungry for your love tonightHoney, I can't waitYou're the oneI swear I need youNo more talkin' on the telephoneNo more knockin' at your doorTonight is yours and mineWe'll turn back the hands of timeMaybe then you'll seeThe kind of love inside of me10,000 yearsI'm gonna love you10,000 years tearsI'll wash away10,000 reasons babyI'm stilll thinking of youMy heart won't last another lonely dayCity moon across the waterEase that velvet tongue across your lipsOoh, you know how to burn my soulWith pure desireOoh baby, baby, don't keep me at your fingertips

Face down, don't turn aroundListen to the bass poundFrom all type of angles This ain't no star spangled bannerMore juice than tropicanaRock from New York to Savannah'Cause it's Macka Framma? When I go to a showSome run, some come, plenty have funTo watch a nig get dumbThe right way, the hype way, the tight wayYou're fucking right that I might say Frontiers get confronted while stunts get stuntedAnd my homies get blunted while the rats get huntedSo if you want it here it is, so put 'em up or shut 'em upSmack 'em down and I'll yell, pick 'em up, so get 'em upWord 'em up, as I fuck it up, I tear it up So listen up and don't move, just play the grooveDon't dime when I crime 'cause kid that'sFessin' up but when I pull out my magJust raise 'em up Frontiers get confronted while stunts get stuntedAnd my homies get blunted while the rats get huntedSo if you want it here it is, so put 'em up or shut 'em upSmack 'em down and I'll yell, pick 'em up, so get 'em upWord 'em up, as I fuck it up, I tear it up So listen up and don't move, just play the grooveDon't dime when I crime 'cause kid that'sFessin' up but when I pull out my magJust raise 'em up One to the three to the motherfuckin' twoAnd you don't know what I'ma doThat's because you're newBut I got the kaya ta make you feel higher So say what you want, you motherfuckin' liarDon't mean to boast, I don't mean to bragBut I got the grab bag of funky shit you wish you hadBut it's the pace that we gotta pick up, so stick 'em up Hands high, reach for the skyBut don't try to get fly 'cause it's easy to dieJust like a blink of an eye when the shots rangBoom bang rat ta tat tat Watch your back 'cause I'm coming blackKill that yig yag, put the money in the bagPass the zags with the Billboard MagBut freeze, feel the breeze if ya sneeze than you're shotNow ya gotta run, what'cha got Frontiers get confronted while stunts get stuntedAnd my homies get blunted while the rats get huntedSo if you want it here it is, so put 'em up or shut 'em upSmack 'em down and I'll yell, pick 'em up, so get 'em upWord 'em up, as I fuck it up, I tear it up So listen up and don't move, just play the grooveDon't dime when I crime 'cause kid that'sFessin' up but when I pull out my magJust raise 'em up
