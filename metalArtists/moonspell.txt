Forever young in a ground so coldThe splendor of your death still fresh to beholdIn your neck an open woundTo spawn life into your loveAnd to feed the creatures of our worldWe have tasted from the poisoned gift of loveWhich condemned us to forever fly aloneWe have experienced an aged potionThe wine of life which stole us lightMay we gather again and be as oneAnd to forever relish in the twin joysAs we taste from the poisoned gift of loveForever young in a ground so coldThe splendour of your dance still there to beholdOur legend is a sin in tonguesTo eternal sleep, to trance we belongWe are now but an empty glancePalid is your state of graceTo eternal sleep we belongFeeling the rapture of the worldBeneath the violence of this curseFrom the poisoned gift of loveOnce I asked you to flyTonight I recreate the vow:Do not fail to love meAs I have failed to dieWith you...
Now you dream insideHer sleep of death.You get to keep your soulUntil she claims it back.A darkness without end.Morning was drained.Here comes the rain.And on the other side,All is dark again.And the dark wallsAt your side again.And you walkThe darkside again.You are the dream insideHer sleep of death.And as I move through her soulI'll find you hiding in there:The darkness with no end.With a light of herself.No one can forget.And on the other sideAll is dark againAnd the dark wallsAt your side again.And you walkThe darkside again.May you walk the darkside again.And you walkThe darkside again.

A pure veil of darkness.A mysterious fog.The Moon is full.And the Wolves you call.Red as my blood it is the sky above us.As I witness the arrival of the Winter Solstice.And I cry from the abyss with the legions of Lilith.Who grant me, son of Goat, the virtues if the black oath.And I climb upon the Raven Mountain and yell.Oh! Thunders of light and pyres of flames- Fire is my domain -Oh! Freezing breezes, rain and snow- Winter is my domain -So I invocate: Eaaaaaaa! Winter rise!..And the Ancient Winter Goddess risesAnd sits in her throne of snow and stone.Soon red morning will born and white is the sky above us.And by the powers of WinterDie!

Arms towering into fearFeels like I am going in my sleepThe dead are breeding under my pillowIs there a place for you in me?Best forgottenGates closing when you draw nearAt the very heart of melancholiaThose were his last wordsIs there still something to die for?Inside my heart a wastelandThat only you can fill with lifeFor ther are strangers in our wayPulling us under, dreaming us under tonightAs certain as the graveIf I lie to you againImposed in the darknessEvery word is trueAnd best forgottenWords surrender into a sealMy life is a curse I keep to myselfThe dead are breaking under my pillowMemories of when you were thereBest forgottenLips drying when you are nearAt the very pit of melancholiaThose were her last soulsIs there still something to dream of?Inside my heart a wasteland stillThat only you could make me feelFor there are snakes in our wayFeeling us under, nesting us under tonightAs certain as the grave if I lie to you againImposed in the darknessEvery word is trueAnd best forgotten

Snowbird, ablaze and hurt.Brighter, fearless, just like a runaway.Princess never-a-smile.Oh, child, what makes you try?Crying and sobbingYou greet the other day She who never touches ground.Spreading an eclipse.Where never the sun shines,At her feet.Frostbite, astray, will, faith.Haunting, hunting ,she rules the game.Twin soul you are always a strange.Nothing ever makes you afraid?Promising, threatening.She looks the other wayShe who never touches ground.Spreading an eclipse.Where never the sun shinesAt her feet.Starlike, but never to be counted.Look at your hands, child!Destinies grow back to them.Daughter sunWith nothing to say.Never a full moonJust the sickening ray.Prudent.In tears hiding,No water shed.The sign of the CrossWill take you to bed.In Capricorn.Spreading an eclipseMay never the sun shineAt her feet

The fury of watersRevolving still,Your voices are silencesWhen they speak through me.To the crossroadsWe are turning our backsAnd in each of you woundsI will plant a seed of beliefIn and above menThe end which is oursUnclear still,The thirst growing strongerAnd you still won't believe:Someday we'll come out of our dreams,And through the eyes you now closeThe immense light of the DeepIn and above MenmThe fury of humanRevolting still.Will we be together?Finally.In the crossroadYou gave me your backAnd through each of your woundsYou'll bleed the light over meBleeding the skies all over me

The cold nights have awakened MeThe soft winds to undress MeThe nails of two witches hav touched MeTheir caress cuts like the sharpest iceYes it is their way, this so mysterious wayof welcoming Me, welcoming MeTheir way to rememberDistant nights of Passion and DoomWhere, naked, have I bathed in velvet watersWitnessed by an accomplice smile inside an innocent MoonSerene were the beings who guided MeEmpty were the hands which undresses MeTo carve strange symbols unknown to Mebut lay so dearly inside of MeThis is my way, this so mysterious wayof welcoming She, welcoming SheMy way to rememberDistant nights of Passion and DoomWhere we both wore flesh crowns to defyThe skies in their blue and so vague tyrannyWe are mute villainsdrinking of Love as insolent VampiresValsing through stars and skiesat that and all to come Winter nightsLike neophyte ravens in the strangest nestCharmed by the wilderness of this strange hostDrawing naivety with our blood and semenRitually engraved in our hearts and chestsMarks of a pain, signs of a love crimeThat will forever and never lastIt is our way, this so mysterious way of lovingof welcoming thee, welcoming theeOur way to rememberForever lost nights of Passion and DoomRemembrance served in cups .of sorrow and prideFor all the eternities we'll still cryFor having lost amidst the stars our brideUntouchable in her smile, inside the great Silver EyeEvery night she is condemned to shine

Bleed no reflectionUpon the waters that you fearMake things happenAccept no resignationFor some life has been cruelYou have set the moodThinking about you, LunaLay the serpent's eggIn this world of make believeAnd make things realMy seed of a lunacyWas a sign made to resistA mood set from birthThinking about you, LunaShow me your moon burnsTake me as the moon burnsThe freezing moonMaking things real for meThe killing moonMaking things happen for meLuna, all aboveWound of light in the enemy skiesMake things happen for meOn the eve of self destructionOn the eve of all can be, thinking about you
The Principles firmly confused.Shake them awake. The circles vicious.All full of wishes.The vapours which invite us in.In hope we bring the final piece.Afrais of what it means.The icy patterns ascending dead.As I decide to stay.And cover with shadows my comeback way.I look outside and it's lunar still.

I remember her as a childRaven, on and on with her raven clawsCarving, on and on with her raven clawsHow she lusts when she remembersThe night of her first blowShe always wanted to knowHow far could she really goInflamed, a dead-end roomSeduce to consumeNightsilence, Vampire, EmpireStatues with open woundsThe flavour of poison and moonStill maturing on her bloodShe is not your occasional affair, no!But eternal love, drop by dropRaven, on and on with her raven clawsCarving, on and on with her raven clawsHow daylight hurts when moonlight bitesShe juggles with her invisible knifeA black bird senses danger and fliesGives peace to a tall figure in the darkLittle silhouette snakes finda warm nest behind the doorAnd whip-tongues and skinsof sisters now gone.Bodyprints cover the velvet floorWhich grows red and redThey know she will hunt and hurt tonightAnd they crown her Queen of the Dead.Raven, on and on with her raven clawsRaping, on and on with her raven clawsWill she weep for them or whip them once again?

"Fly, serpent of pride,Mother of earth, our MotherLaw of those who claimFor the Homo Natura, for the flame,Fly erotic PentagramAnd destroy, destroy those who love us."Langsuyar T. RexFall 1993 e.v."I would masturbate over your divinity,Sodomize you if your feeble existencewould offer an ass to my incontinence;My arm thy heart would pull outSo that with my profound horror better could I penetrate you."


Hate is the place where a man finally isThat flame that feels us colderHate is the place where a man finally winsThe character in the strongerAn ambition never seenI refuse to turn my face awayNever waited on you brothers of blood:Your tomorrow was yesterdayGreater lessons learnedUpon the blood of menDisaster struck higher than othersGreater lessons learnedUpon the blood of menA destiny like no otherHate is a palace that a man finally entersTo claim the freedom to escapeHate is what grows in disturb between usTenderness, heartache and shameIn the challenge of our dreamsMemory will bring us togetherScreaming in the heart of the insane:For tomorrow was yesterdayGreater lessons learnedUpon the blood of menDisaster struck higher than othersGreater lessons learnedUpon the blood of menA destiny like no other(Men so violently ashamed)A creation like no otherRefused upon the blood of meNever wait, for everything is vainAnd tomorrow was yesterdayGreater lessons learnedUpon the blood of menDisaster struck higher than othersGreater lessons learnedUpon the blood of menA destiny like no otherA tragedy like no other


She brought the Night hidden in her sad Wolf eyesThe perfume of a twilight, her strongest scentHalf Wolf, Half female - what a strange weddingMother Nature has offered us to see...Her mask lays lost in a fatal dawnClosed were the eyes of the Sun, He sleepsAnd in the name of Her Father,She will kill. My child kills.Your nightly birth. A requiem God can't forget.For your life is but a celebration of his death.Without his thorns in her heart. She wears a shadow as faceA werewolf masquerade. In her eyes the wolfshadeShe brought the Night and by the night was broughtWe are but children of the powers she had set freeStrange are the ways of the wolfhearted...
Near the howling...As the light falls and darkness paints the sky in black,A cold Moon shines and the red sombre eyes awake, the forest whispersWhispers my unholy name, from a frozen mis I rise, I Wolf rise!And my brothers will attack under this blood sign.Wolves from the fog will join in a nocturnal operetta.When the wind sounds bohemia and the trumpets loud bacanal.Oh! Fausts and ninfs the joy of Nahima, Mistress of the Sabbat.Soon we'll be embraced by our father - the one with horns.Satan is rejoicing in pleasure destroying the shapes of flesh....and once again from the fog, with horns on headCame the Wolf carrying in is shoulder the sacrifice,A beauty to this Walpurgis Eve.As, to the sombre image of our God,The Wolf with Horns I walk!
