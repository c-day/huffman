I'm just a human being A mistake made of feelings With a soul...wrapping in chains So fragile, full of pain No one knows why we are here Giving laughter and so many tears I will just do my best To keep my head above the restNo one really knows Which way the wind blowsOne day the tides will turn One day the fields will burn One day the seas will churn The fury of out maker's handMan is a mistake cast out Shunned and cast down Giving life through breathe of gods W With itself always at odds The pious the preacher The liar, the creature F rom rock to fire The dust of manO my maker I need a saviorOne day the tides will turn O ne day the fields will burn One day the seas will churn T he fury of our makers handThe fury. The fury What will you do?
