Time and time again I stand at the crossroad.Where the weight of my burden eclipses my resolve.This broken path I've chosen, I walk it alone.Though I feel forgotten, you've carved my name in stone.[Chorus]In these desperate times.This I plead.When all else fails remember me.This is daily crucifixion and these rusty nails leave scars.My jagged crown is at my side.Anguish is never far.[Chorus]This is a blood-oath.They are nothing to me anymore.But your voice means more to me than you'll ever know.There's no question, you're the answer.I will find you.[Chorus: x2]

Pacing aimlessly,With my mind in unrestUnsure of what may come.What have I done to bring this down on me?Helpless to make this undoneAll in due time, see the world through different eyes.All in due time, the shadows will give way to light.How much more can I give of myself,As these walls close in on me?As I slip down in to this despair(Into this despair),There is nothing to attainWhat victory(What victory)When my soul is weak,(Is weak)where does my help come from?All in due time, see the world through different eyes.I see the world through different eyes.All in due time, shadows will give way, give way to light.All that we suffer through leads to determination.The trials we all go through gives us the strength to carry on.Something within us burns, desire feeds the will to live.A reason to believe I will see redemption.All in due time, see the world through different eyesI see the world through different eyesAll in due time, the shadows will give way to light.All in due time.

The Time Approaches Fall!This is the voice of the VoicelessWe have learned about making choicesNot of persecution or dilutionWe have severed the solutionTo build our foundation on natural elements to preserve lifeWe will rise and battle onChanting inspiration for the righteous Dislocation from the social order Kingdoms will rise to power But kingdoms fall to dust To ashes of the dead Will be a sign The time approaches Arms raised (raised)Eyes gazed (gazed)Tongues of fire whisper This life (life)Will soon (soon)Slip away!

Their cries are blown away with the windHow passive can we be before humanity is lost?Turning our backs on those who need love.We must not rest while healing is needed.Tear down the veil that bars your heart from feeling this.Dedicate yourself.Give your souls to compassion.With open arms embrace this heart.With open eyes behold the truth.Embrace this life.So little time is left.We must be relentless in our pursuit of those in torment.Tear down the veil that bars your heart from feeling this.Dedicate yourself.Become the voice of compassion.With open arms embrace this heart.With open eyes behold the truth.Embrace this life.Can you reject yourself?Can you feel their agony?In a world that feeds on disregard.Heal the broken hearted.

Who knows how long I've been lost in the dark.Followed.Closely by the footsteps of my failures.What can I do to alter my perception of the way and the truth? Let this burden drift away.Who knows how long the void has swallowed me.I only wish for nothing more than peace to find me.My pledge remains faithful to you.And my heart still beats your name Drowning Once again.Will I live another day? To reach the surface Let this burdon Drift away Drowning Choking Fading life is this the moment where I leave the blacknessIs this the moment of my rebirth Who knows how long I've been lost in the dark.Followed.Closely by the footsteps of my failures.What can I do to alter my perception of the way and the truth? Drowning Once again.Will I live another day? To reach the surface Let this burdon Drift away x2
Watching once moreAs the world passes me bySurrounded but still all aloneAm I living a lie?Empty faces, empty eyesAre staring right through me.No regret, but still ask whyTake me awayTo a place I've never knownThis is the price I've paid,And it's taken it's toll.Can it be too much to askFor the time it stole?Empty faces, empty eyesAre staring right through me.No regret, but still ask whyTake me awayTo a place I've never knownTake me awayWhere my life can be my own.I only wish that I had stayedI only wish that I had knownTake me awayTo a place I've never knownTake me awayThen my life can be my own.Where my life can be my own.Take me awayTake me away.

Make me feel serenity when all is revealedSo easy to look back in life and questionBut I must seek to find the strengthTo push forwardI want to see what's so beautiful insideAs we drink of life eternalAbsolve me through your sufferingTeach me to inscribeThese words on my heartCover me with the shadow of your handI will not loose myself in everything that tears me downBecause you stand by meNo one to blame for my transgressionsNo one to blame but myself
Imprisoned, inside this mindHiding behind the empty smilesSo simple (the anguish)As it mocks meCrawling back into the darkRunning, always running, into the distanceStop me before I bleed, againThe echoes of my voiceFollow me downThe shadows I castFollow me downDeeper I'm fallingInto the arms of sorrowQuickly descendingInto the arms of sorrowThere must be serenityThe echoes of my voiceFollow me downThe shadows I castFollow me downDeeper I'm fallingInto the arms of sorrowBlindly descendingInto the arms of sorrowThe demons of my own designThis horror must not remainDeeper I'm fallingInto the arms of sorrowBlindly descendingInto the arms of sorrowThere must be serenityThere must be deliveranceDeeper I'm fallingBlindly descendingDeeper I'm falling
The sound of footsteps approaching.A storm of shadows reveal a figure forlorn.Whispering voices that slither into our ears,As temptation sings and beckons us to fall.Under the skin, the blood begins to crawl.Rush to the heart, drain it from the soul.Come face to face with all you can't escape.Will you hold your ground or turn away?Release your, inhibitions, and answer to the call.The sun shines down to reveal a true image.Salvation sings and shows us all we know.The road is treacherous and lonely filled,With the empty inventions of the soul.Under disillusion, run from confrontation,Or do we heed the judgement call?Release your, inhibitions, and answer to the call.Leave behind this shell of flesh and bone.In the end we will answer to the call.The burning question remains, how much is too much to give?Do your wings have the strength to carry on?When we see redemption, how long will we wait for deliverance?It takes everything to keep from falling now, let go.Release your, inhibitions, and answer to the call.Leave behind this shell of flesh and bone.In the end we will answer to the call.

My strength fails me Your picture A bitter memoryFor comfortFor solace(Seek me) for comfort(Call me) for solace(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart

Fall down into the chaos.Staring into the depths of pain darkness and suffering.I will not be moved from this place, inside of me.Until I understand this part of me that bleeds and captures my spirit.If it's the death of me, then I will losen it's grip.Protect me from the hell that burns inside of me.No one can see this is the hell in me.Bring light into the darkness.Awaken and stir this war within us all.Reveal my true intentions.No one can see this is the hell in me.Will you set me free?This is the hell in me.Lead me out of the darkness.Strengthen and protect the voice that makes no sound.Suffer and bleed for me.Pulled from the hell that is in me.Set me free.Protect me from the hell that burns inside of me.No one can see this is the hell in me.Will you set me free?This is the hell in me.
