Mine field is called the place I'm living in,Carefully watching each and every step I take.Bright white straight jacket chokes me offMy eyes are tired...I... feel the cold steel on my forehead.Like... binding pleasure of being dead.Downward future!

The night of timeless fire is drawing nearI flee, throughout the years of throeWatching through a mirror, as I fall apartI see a wreck, I'm burningI see angels burning, falling down in ruinsLooking down I see me, I'm my own enemyWatching myself decaying, falling from high spiritsI flee, throughout the ruins of meLonging for finding my way outLeaving myself, there's nothing left for meThe ruins are about to crumble down.The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skiesIt reflects hatred in my eyesI see angels burning, falling down in ruinsLooking down I see my ashes scattered around my graveAngels whispering fire, no longer I'm aliveSettled down I'm done with the trip to my kingdom come

Throughout the ruins of meLonging for finding my way outLeaving myself, there's nothing left for meThe ruins are about to crumble down.The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skiesIt reflects hatred in my eyesI see angels burning, falling down in ruinsLooking down I see my ashes scattered around my graveAngels whispering fire, no longer I'm aliveSettled down I'm done with the trip to my kingdom come
The faint blaze of the candle of my life,Slowly dying like a fire in a pouring rain.No sparks of hope inside,No shooting stars on my sky.On broken wings, no flying highAnother night, another demise,Cadaverous wind blowing cold as iceI'll let the wind blow out the lightCause its gets more painful every time i die.Out of strength to fight.I cannot take another night.I cannot take it no more.Lust of light slips through my fingerslike blood on my arms.Black candle wax has buried meAnother night, another demise,Cadaverous wind blowing cold as iceI'll let the wind blow out the lightCause its gets more painful every time i die.
I am a man who walks aloneAnd when I'm walking in a dark roadAt night or strolling through the park When the lights begins to changeI sometimes feel a little strangeA little anxious when it's dark Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a constant fear that something'sAlways nearFear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a phobia that someone'sAlways there Have you run your fingers downThe wallAnd have you felt your neck skin crawlWhen you're searching for the light?Sometimes when you're scaredTo take a lookAt the corner of the roomYou've sensed that something'sWatching you Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a constant fear that something'sAlways nearFear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a phobia that someone'sAlways there Have you ever been alone at nightThought you heard footsteps behindAnd turned around and no one's there?And as you quicken up your paceYou'll find it hard to look againBecause you're sure thatSomeone's there Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a constant fear that something'sAlways nearFear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a phobia that someone'sAlways there Watching horror films the night beforeDebating witches and folkloresThe unknown troubles on your mindMaybe your mind is playing tricksYou sense, and suddenly eyes fixOn dancing shadows from behind Fear of the dark, fear of the darkI have constant fear that something'sAlways nearFear of the dark, fear of the darkI have a phobia that someone'sAlways there When I'm walking a dark roadI am a man who walks alone

An old cowboy went out ridin' outone dark and windy dayUpon a ridge he restedas he went along his wayWhen all at once a mighty herdof red-eyed cows he sawPlowing through the raggedsky and up a cloudy drawYippie-aye-aee, yippie-aye-ohh,Ghost riders in the skyTheir brands were still on fireAnd their hooves were made of steelTheir horns were black and shiningAnd their hot breath he could feelA bolt of fear went through himAs they thundered through the skyFor he saw the riders coming hardAnd he heard their mournful cryYippie-aye-ooh, yippie-aye-aee,Ghost riders in the skyTheir faces gaunt their eyesWere blurred and shirts all soaked with sweatHe's riding hard to catch that herdBut he ain't caught them yet'Cause they've got to ride foreverOn that range up in the skyOn horses snorting fireAs they ride on hear their cryYippie-aye-aee, yippie-aye-ohh,Ghost riders in the skyAs the riders rode on by himHe heard one call his nameIf you want to save your soulfrom hell a-riding on our rangeThen cowboy change your ways todayOr with us you will rideA-trying to catch the devil's herdAcross these endless skiesYippie-aye-aee, yippie-aye-ooh,Ghost riders in the skyYippie-aye-aee, yippie-aye-ooh,Ghost riders in the sky
I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime.Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time.'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows pole,The sands of time for me are running low.When the priest comes to read me the last rites,I take a look through the bars at the last sights,Of a world that has gone very wrong for me.Can it be that there's some sort of error.Hard to stop the surmounting terror.Is it really the end, not some crazy dream.Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming,It's not easy to stop from screaming,But words escape me when I try to speak.Tears fall but why am I crying,After all I'm not afraid of dying.Don't I believe that there never is an end.As the guards march me out to the courtyard,Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you".If there's a God then why has he let me go?As I walk all my life drifts before meAnd though the end is near I'm not sorryCatch my soul cos' it's willing to fly awayMark my words please believe my soul lives onPlease don't worry now that I have goneI've gone beyond to see the truthWhen you know that your time is close at hand,Maybe then you'll begin to understandLife down here is just a strange illusion.Ohh ohh ohhh... Hallowed be thy nameOhh ohh ohhh... Hallowed be thy name

[Iron Maiden Cover] Into the abyss I'll fall-the eye of HorusInto the eyes of the night-watching me goGreen is the cat's eye that glows-in this templeEnter the risen Osiris-risen again. Tell me why I had to be a powerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid waste.And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the power of death. When I was living this lie-fear was my gamePeople would worship and fall-drop to their kneesSo bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed meFor he is a man and a god-and he will die too. Tell me why I had to be a powerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid waste.And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the power of death. Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stoneShell of a man God preserved-a thousand agesBut open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave. Tell me why I had to be a powerslaveI don't wanna die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid waste.And in my last hour,I'm a slave to the power of death.

You'll take my life but I'll take yours tooYou'll fire your musket but I'll run you throughSo when you're waiting for the next attackYou'd better stand there's no turning back. The bugle sounds and the charge beginsBut on this battlefield no one winsThe smell of acrid smoke and horses breathAs I plunge on into fucking death. The horse he sweats with fear we break to runThe mighty roar of the Russian gunsAnd as we race towards the human wallThe screams of pain as my comrades fall We hurdle bodies that lay on the groundAnd the Russians fire another roundWe get so near yet so far awayWe won't live to fight another day. We get so close near enough to fightWhen a Russian gets me in his sightsHe pulls the trigger and I feel the blowA burst of rounds take my horse below. And as I lay there gazing at the skyMy body's numb and my throat is dryAnd as I lay forgotten and aloneWithout a tear I draw my parting groan

No flickering light at the end of the pathConfront repressions of the pastFear. Prevail. Insanity. Obey!Draw back in silence to dwell in anxietyNo matter where I am, I'm aloneMy dreams are shatteredinto thousand running tearsThe tears keep dripping down, down,deep, down from my veinsI'm walking towards dead end I'm walking all aloneTwo steps behind insanityThere's no starlight guiding my way throughout this downward death rowSoon will be the time I have to goLittle by little the end is drawing nearAnother night and so little blood to spare(Ya can hurt me, but ya can't possess me 'why know)Kill me, hurt me, fuck me, rape me, you won't have me!Draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety,No matter where I am, I'm alone. I'm crying out loudthe tears of blood I bleed, so fuck the world,I'll go now, I don't care. (Who cares?)I'm walking towards dead end, and I'm walking all aloneTwo steps ago I past insanityThere's no starlight guiding my way out this downward death rowSo now is the time I have to go
Trapped in the light like nothing was wrong Put the words where I don't belong Now hear the fallen angel Sing my requiem Take a step past the light where I die Flashback and your living in sin It hurts so bad Like a war within Looking at the blank river of my life Staring out with the evil to my lies Keep the promise if you ever will Just say the word, just kill go kill Wrapped in the edge of my demise You still cry my final goodbyes When the years of cold love left their dreadful nightTry to move, let me out to my soulJet black so out of control So now shout to him in criesKill them allLooking at the blank river of my life Staring out with the evil to my lies Keep the promise if you ever will Just say the word, just kill go killGO!Looking at the blank river of my life Staring out with the evil to my lies Keep the promise if you ever will Just say the word, just kill go kill
What you mean for the?Question of youTrying to be kicking ass to help me?After you know I never to goBefore I go high,I'm very downYou know I'm strong enough to get it againYou try to be on the way,Not be trashed, lost and strungoutWhen together try something drug and you question me what's to coming outBefore I go high,I'm very downYou know I'm strong enough to get it againCome on!Maybe I ? fucking more, I turn to youAnd trashed people asking my?Tell me where to fuck to goWhatever getting to the point where cracking it you, nothing hard trying to be some out of youLet me down where you down below, to the?You may goWell, let me in, I raise my slavery well,For the not by your reflectionForever I saw kiss you goodbye,So kill my soul and dictionBefore I blow my needle groundYou me poor, I never returnUp and next you tell me what to goAnd you know I'm strong enough to get it againWhatever getting to the point where cracking it you, nothing hard trying to be some out of youLet me down where you down below,To the? you may goWell, let me in, I raise my slavery well,For the not by your reflectionForever I saw kiss you goodbye,So kill my soul and diction
Like I said, I'm ready to goEase my pain desireLast night I begged to godLight my heart to fireLet me pour some taste downSee my last silent pain desireLet me take a last breathBefore I saw, blind my eyesTriple corpse hammerblowTriple corpse hammerblowDon't push me...Don't push me...Don't push me!Let it trust my great vowLife goes away fasterLet it trust the meaningLike life it was way beforeMove away the blow outLike it was by silent BodomThe way it feels, like it feel beforeHow you feel, feel before!Triple corpse hammerblowDon't push me...Don't push me...Don't push me!
Woke up to the sound of lucidity, feet on the groundOverwhelming delight wipes out the wreck of myHollow mindBut when the dreams turn violentRepulsive mirror likeness, if you lay out my broken bonesBeat up my heart with thirteen holesWould want to see the tragedyOf a mind that once belonged to meTake one good glance and you'll agreeLike I said it's ugly, so goddamn uglyAfter the terror you've seenTry to act like good human beingGuess the ship I did steer, sank in the seaOf self loathing and fear
(Instrumental)
I'm an outcast on the path of rebound Everything is frail, I desolate, crush, and burn I have chosen darkness to be my guide War is in my heart, death is by my side [Chorus]War heart! With no remains of compassion or love War heart! Hate your fellow as yourself I have chosen night to be my guide When the daylight strikes, I hide in my trench and die [Chorus]I'm the war heart, I'm dying to win the battle I live everyday One for all and all for me, I'm an animal, better set me free
I've been dragged throughMud hereEntirely beat up and tornBut when last nightComes back to me I sure as hell knowWe rocked, went crazyAnd far beyondWhen I look backAnd ask myselfWas it worth it?Hell yeah Ignore the PainHungoverBut I'll do it againCryingTears made of gritFlyingOh yea, it was worth itWithdrawal kickin' in. I can't shake itYet in one way I have to take itI'll rock. Go nutsAnd far beyondAnd I look backI don't need to knowWas it worth it?
