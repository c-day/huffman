Thirteen times I went to the wellTo draw my thoughts, I'll gather and tellLike bricks that I've laid to build my lifeThose that crumbled only caused me strifeThoughts became words, cast into the seaBut they returned, always haunting meLike a severed arm washed up on the shoreI just don't think I can give anymoreBecause I've lived, how many times do I have to die?Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?Thirteen times and it's been lucky for meAfter everything, you still want me to bleedThirteen ways to see the devil in my eyesBecause I stood here thirteen times and I'm still aliveAt thirteen I started down this pathFueled with anger, music was my wrathYears of clawing at scars that never healedDrowning my mind, the thoughts are too realBecause I've lived, how many times do I have to die?Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?Thirteen times and it's been lucky for meAfter everything, you still want me to bleedThirteen ways to see the devil in my eyesBecause I stood here thirteen times and I'm still aliveI can't get out, I can't jump outToo much to face, I can't eraseBecause I've lived, how many times do I have to die?Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?Thirteen times and it's been lucky for meAfter everything, you still want me to bleedThirteen ways to see the devil in my eyesBecause I stood here thirteen times and I'm still aliveI can't get out, I can't jump outToo much to face, I can't eraseThirteen times and it's been lucky for me
Grinding my teeth, white knuckles grasp at the wheelI rush from an avalanche of adrenaline, it's all that I feelAs quick as a bolt of lightning, a rocket ride in a bucket seatIt doesn't get any better than this, it just feeds my need for speedSupercharged, strapped in and screamingFire spiting from the pipesA burnout by the flame throwing fury8, 000 horses igniteFull throttle, hit the ground runningWith a tank full of nitroAnd it's 1, 320' to go to the finish lineMy hands hold tight, a fire breathing stampedeI fall into a trance, hold my breath till the light turns greenIn a cloud of nitro methane, melting rubber, I say my prayersMan and machine accelerate and I vanish in thin airSupercharged, strapped in and screamingFire spiting from the pipesA burnout by the flame throwing fury8, 000 horses igniteFull throttle, hit the ground runningWith a tank full of nitroAnd it's 1, 320' to go to the finish line
I. Introduction "November 1, 2552 A.D. The spaceship Evilzone arrives on Nuquledom, a bizar-Re planet located 600 billion miles, 10 and a half to the equator... sinist-Er forces abide by moonlight as scientists devise plots to detonate human desires and brutality amongst space travelers in the best interest of the solar system... In the darkest regions of dark space, slayers, offenders andAlien abductors are taking over Nuquledom, having slain humans and extrater-Restrial beings by stalking brains and facing fear amongst the farest areasOf this dreadful plante, the torture affecting their fate will be destroyedBy sinister extraterrestrial masterminds - eventually destroying the wholePlanet, not only by chance, but by nuclear annihilation."    "As the solar system evolves into one curiosity-conscious force of death,The end of the world will take place for 3,450 years and 2,700 centuries...Forcing Nuquledom on certain areas of attack... for billions of weeks, daysAnd months."  And now, the destruction of Nuquledom begins.  II. 2552 Overture (Instrumental)(20-minute version)  III. Truce Over Agony  Death and darkness are all around this planet Everytime the planet explodes quickly in a future time For each bullet of plutonium being hit there Evil is the enemy of indestructible decline For this is the kingdom and we are the troubleshooters Truce over agony will reign again - forever  Our society changes constantly Torture is within life's hidden reach This time, extraterrestrials turn head around the earth And continue turning them around without terminal breach For this is the kingdom and we are the troubleshooters Truce over agony will reign again - forever  IV. The Cranial Clock  "To think, the planet Nuquledom has evolved into an indestructible village- a world of the extraterrestrial underground where human and other adversa-Ries attack. As I enter the experimental intergalatic development center...Known as the National Association for Planetary Research... My partner in planetary combat has completed the development of a experimental space trav-El adventure policy. He tells me when this scheme happens over the next fewYears as scientists and mercenaries began the 52,000-week intergalatic batt-Leground. What the sciensts come up with will be the creation of the crani-Al clock."     "As the battle for control of the Ideatric System begins in honest, theDestruction of Nuquledom is carried out by the forces of evil... the wrathOf Nuquledom will be completed in 52,000 weeks; death is surrounded by theInquisities of the National Association for Planetary Research by hard ways - doing everything the interrogators have in their power to survive."  Most often, by the sinister forces of evil in Nuquledom Having performed their random acts of brutal distraction What matters most likely, should they destroy the entire planet of life No one is safe because of galatiic annihilation  We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil  Just stare at the interplanetary man He gives each man a helping hand Join in the Brothership of Mind Control And attack each other by slamming intergalactic windfall  We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil  Pessimism is falling as time slips away Every space travel is being implanted with a computer chip The travails of hell is as vital as it is brutal No attention contact within every day  IIV. Interrogation Conspiracy Trap    "In June of 2553, the National Association for Planetary Research is em-Barking on a plan to detonate Nuquledom, as spaceship pilots continue theirBattle for semantic combat during the first year of the annihilation of thePlanet."   "For the slayers of human bodies, alien invaders attack the psychologicalMystique found deep inside the realm of death. Nuquledom's commander in chief, Rex Nuclear, Ph.D., devises an early warning conspiracy that allowsNuquledom to be blown up piecemeal within the next few decades."  No attention contact No attention contact Torture is coming Torture is coming Torture is coming No attention contact No attention contact Torture is coming Torture is coming Torture is coming  No attention contact No attention contact Torture is coming Torture is coming Torture is coming No attention contact No attention contact Torture is coming Torture is coming Torture is coming  No attention contact No attention contact Torture is coming Torture is coming Torture is coming No attention contact No attention contact Torture is coming Torture is coming Torture is coming    No attention contact No attention contact Torture is coming Torture is coming Torture is coming No attention contact No attention contact Torture is coming Tourture is coming Torture is coming   V. Death Kills The Planet      "Even now distraction erupts again as the forces of danger dangle alongNuquledom and the 25 planets of the Ideatric System by detonating all areasOf this dreadful community of extraterrestrial life. In the kingdom of inde-Structiveness, torture, death and greed subside in harmony as the annihilat-Ion of Nuquledom continues in the year 2557."  "What happens to visitors when they land on Nuquledom will see a great dealOf intergalatic fears and brutal straits of hell. I must oppose the abductorAnd the scientist battling for control of the Ideatric System; and the fearsConcerning Nuquledom are in flux as troubleshooters duke their traits of hell as the senses of sight, taste, hearing and touching coexsist."  "Let the destruction of the Ideatric System continue..."  Shoot the laws of gravity in space Shoot stars directing interplanetary grace Go after the darkness in the galaxy Destroy all inhuman thought and reveal the alien enemy Know what space travelers believe in humanity What happens to the planetary straits affecting our society  Shoot back at torture and run all fear around Not for the sake of heart, making for the last guy abound Shoot back at the enemy behind enemy lines Heating up controversy concerning inhuman decline Under attack, slayers have been executed Not by force, but by abduction Face your intergalatic fears, vying to face destruction  VI. 2552 Overture (15-Minute Finale)
It was a cool winter's morningSomewhere shortly past 9:00 AMThe armored car they wanted to heist wasn't comingSo instead they went for the bankThe fateful duo that sat in the get-away carHeavily sedated with thousands of roundArmor piercing, fully automatic weaponsThe bowls of wrath poured out on the ground[Chorus]Baptized in a firefightHot blood running cold as iceForty four minutes of target practiceAll hell's breaking looseOutgunned, watching "The Force" come to a firefight with a pocketknifeGetting schooled until they shot Achilles' heelAnd brought down the beast!!!This was an accident waiting to happenIt wasn't if it would happen, it was whenThe city's people sabotaged themselvesCalling their firepower an unneeded expenseThe two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stoppedStandard police issue guns were just not enoughBut SWAT arrived to settled the fightBetween AK-47 and AR-15[Chorus: x2]
"Pull over, shithead, this is the cops!" Full tank, pockets lined with cash Full throttle, gonna rip some ass. Drive all day and through the night, Romance the road, winding left to right. The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free. A feeling inside me and the whole world to see. Driving fast makes me feel good, The speed of light trapped under my hood. Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do. Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502. Hundreds of miles rolled off today. Signs lose their meanings, minutes tick away. Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all. Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol. Drive until daybreak, always on the go. Life on the freeway, night shift 'til dawn patrol. Driving fast makes me feel good, The speed of light trapped under my hood. Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do. Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502. Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you. Stars above guide me This feeling inside me I drive until daybreak. Life on the freeway is Hell. I'm coming through 
If I see the morning hoursI'll have one more yesterdayTake life from tomorrow'Cause I've burned out my today If I get up to the top I knowI'll just go back downhillGotta' terminal futureAnd it's time to write my will Down another glass of courageAnd a shot of Thorazine [Chorus]We're not ready to see you yet99 ways to dieWe're not ready to see you yet Gotta' short between the earphonesWringing my hands in dismayA more efficient maniacWith two feet in the grave Ain't got no last words to sayYellow streak right up my spineThe gun in my mouth was realAnd the taste blew my mind In a black tie and straight jacketMan I'm gonna try again [Chorus]Demitasse of arsenicTry on this tieNever mind the tree There is only death and dangerIn the sockets of my eyesA playground of illusionNo one plays they only die There's a prison in my mindAnd the bars are gonna breakI'm as mad as a hatterAnd strung out just the same Taunting rigor mortisI feel it draw me in

There's a secret place I like to go Everyone is there but their face don't show If you get inside you can't get out There's no coming back, I hear them shout Welcome to my hide away, my secret place How I arrived I can't explain You're welcome to, if you want to stay But everyone just runs away Let me in, get me out Can't do more than twist and shout Lost my soul without a trace Found it again in my secret place In disgrace I hide from those that try to find me Scary things that's right behind me I lost myself, I must confess I can't explain how I got this mess

Achilles Last Stand (Page/Plant) It was an April morning when they told us we should go As I turn to you, you smiled at me How could we say no? With all the fun to have, to live the dreams we always had Oh, the songs to sing, when we at last return again Sending off a glancing kiss, to those who claim they know Below the streets that steam and hiss, The devil's in his hole Oh to sail away, To sandy lands and other days Oh to touch the dream, Hides inside and never seen. Into the sun the south the north, at last the birds have flown The shackles of commitment fell, In pieces on the ground Oh to ride the wind, To tread the air above the din Oh to laugh aloud, Dancing as we fought the crowd To seek the man whose pointing hand, The giant step unfolds With guidance from the curving path, That churns up into stone If one bell should ring, in celebration for a king So fast the heart should beat, As proud the head with heavy feet. Days went by when you and I, bathed in eternal summers glow As far away and distant, Our mutual child did grow Oh the sweet refrain, Soothes the soul and calms the pain Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again Wandering & wandering, What place to rest the search The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth From the earth... I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way (X2) Oh the mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth.
Only yesterday they told me you were gone All these normal people, will I find another one? Monkey on my back, aching in my bones I forgot you said "One day you'll walk alone" I said I need you, does that make me wrong? Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong? My heart was blackened, it's bloody red A hole in my heart, a hole in my head! Who will help me up? Where's the helping hand? Will you turn on me? Is this my final stand? In a dream I cannot see Tangled abstract fallacy Random turmoil builds in me I'm addicted to chaos Light shined on my path Turn bad days into good Turn breakdowns into blocks, I smashed 'em 'cause I could My brain was labored, my head would spin Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in The rain comes down, cold wind blows The plans we made are back up on the road Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown Remember that you said "One day you'll walk alone"
I lied just a little When I said I need you You stretched the truth When you said that you knew Just can't believe it There's nothing to say I was almost honest, almost Living alone, can't stand this place It's four in the morning and I still see your face I was nearly pure When I said I loved you You were semi-sincere You said I'd bleed for you We were kind of candid Now you've gone away You were almost honest, almost Living alone, falling from grace I want to atone but there's just empty space I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks I question your call by the tone of your voice I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice It happened that night when you told me to go Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know Almost, almost honest Almost, I was almost honest

Down fell the stars and they splashed in the sea. "Mi nomine baphomet," come dance with me. Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites. Their master has come, the moon is full tonight. Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast. The Devil, who's watching, with demons remote. Fire, rising, racing in your blood. Possessed, naive, his service is done. Bloody blasphemy Sinister's the word as the demons take their fill. An orgy's taking place, human blood will spill. And act of worship as they conceive the ghouls. Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes. The ceremony is sure to be cursed. They wait for his blessing but down comes the worst. Their bodies, soulless, a corpse from the grave. Their minds are helpless and no one can save them, No one can save them.

He said he'd try just a little bitHe didn't want to end up like themAnd now he blames the voices of a toothless wonderPounding on the door to make the next scoreAnything for a hit, any sin to pay for itFor that next bowl, he'd sell his soulSpiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spellHe wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hellWithout the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his liesHis cause of death, high speed on burnt iceAlways looking at the ground, a broken, beaten manMemories of his family are calling after himHe can hardly thing, hardly walkPhone keeps ringing, he can't talkWith just one hit the pain would go awayBut he's dead if he doesShadow people follow him everywhere he goesLooking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows

Technology, the battle's unfair, You pull the hammer without a care. Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man, Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned... The hunt is canned All are gone, all but one. No contest, nowhere to run. No more left, only one. This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare. The skin and trophy, oh so rare.

Thermal count is rising in perpetual writhing The primordial ooze and the sanity they lose Awakened in the morning to more air-pollution warnings Still we sleepwalk off to work as our nervous systems jerk Pretending not to notice how history has forbode us With the greenhouse in effect our environment was wrecked Now I can only laugh as I read our epitaph We end our lives as moles in the dark of the dawn patrol

The light that fill my lonely cell, Is blocked out by the key, That locks the door to this hell, The place they wanted me. Time's racing like the wind, Execution's near. Oh Lord, I wait for death, And yes, I have no fear. I recall that night, my every breath, And step along the way. Closed my eyes, walking, As danger paved the way. The devil and the darkness Let her evil wander free. And here on Devil's Island, The final stop for me. Devil's Island! Devil's Island! Oh there's no escape, The sea is full of sharks. The tides take you way And smash you on the rocks. The sun is shining, But feel not today, Its warmth, it's dying, And fading away. Devil's Island! Devil's Island! Oh hear the call, From the grave beyond Oh so pernicious, Her soul could, it creates song. As there is no man that is Here upon the earth, Able to terminate our Noisome will since birth. The priest that reads the sermons, Is walking next to me, To the stake, my last request, To have her burn with me. But so it did, the heavens opened, Rain began to fall. The final judgment came. And was spread before you all. Final Judgment! Old, weak, and feeble, But the lesson taught to me, To stay away from evil, She doesn't care for me. She haunts me in my sleep, Though I tore that page away. And here on Devil's Island, I'll always have to stay. Devil's Island! Devil's Island! Here I am Devil's Island! Devil's Island! 
Sacrilege and blasphemy set the stage today The more insatiable the sex, the more swelled our tongues became As prehistoric as this seems, this is now, today Talkin' about no vision, talkin' about no dream The harlot puddles for her lies from where she speaks I look above and see entrails in the sky This one ain't over until the fat lady dies One man rules the earth and rides a seven headed beast Ten Diadems to crown them all World religion at his feet Dreams are told of dreams of old this day would surely come So run my child and hide your face Once you've been marked you're finished, one You've become one! You're mine! You're one. I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away I saw a new earth today, I saw a former pass away Vengeance is mine! Vengeance is mine!

You live in a world of fantasy You live in a web of deceit You want it all including me You like it all to be neat I come to you when shadows fall I leave as the dawn arrives Hide the truth to deceive them all How my good intention lies Try to silence the suspicions Feeding the dark inhibitions We can never let anyone see The sin I bring called ecstasy The sin I bring ecstasy Secret meetings that we hide Deeds of iniquity The price of foolish pride The cost of immorality And we hide the truth to deceive them all And the pain of what will never be Try to silence the suspicions Feeding the dark inhibitions We can never let anyone see The sin I bring called ecstasy The sin I bring ecstasy 
Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes I hope the end is less painful than my life I stand on trial before the gods On Judgment Day A blink of an eye between The cradle and the grave One last look at visions of flesh The last best hope of man on earth Pontius Pilate still washing his hands The world don't want to be saved Only left alone Elysian Fields... We are storming the heavens To raise our swords and shields We ascend to our destiny To the Elysian Fields Soaring to the sun With blood upon their wings Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind Man still has one belief, One decree that stands alone The laying down of arms Is like cancer to their bones

There once was a familiar faceBattle scars in disarrayA simple man, power drunkNo worries of living, no more anything Deep inside I've seen it riseBastards possesses to no endMirror, mirror, please look insideDo you see the evil that's within? Pyramids of dead men and dogsSpoils of war so they sayOnce burned, forever markedHurt by just a few but so many have to pay Deep inside I've seen it riseBastards possesses to no endMirror, mirror, please look insideDo you see the evil that's within? Pressure coming downDown on me, gonna breakBroken fingernailsDigging in, scratch your face Nervous, like a catGonna jump through my skinShadows on the wallStretching out, grope for me Evil, evilEvil, deep in meEvil, let me beEvil, let me bleed Evil, set me freeEvil, set me freeEvil, set me freeThe evil that's within
Forgotten things remembered The tigers eat their young The body stayed but inside the head The mind was on the run Conspiracy of silence The only way out of pain Is turn around and run through it man Too wet to come in from the rain, Tell them... I know they were doing it to you But don't try doing it to me Let me show you, how I love you It's our secret, you and me Let me show you how I love you But keep it in the family tree... The secret of the family tree When you hear them saying "Trust me" Don't wait to see what's next Thrown to the wolves Forever trusting Raised in a form of living Hell Sing a one note song of rage Live and die within your heart So beware in the shadows Your family tree waits in the dark I say...

Sands in the hourglass fall for us allYou don't answer me anymore when I callSo much is trapped inside, tangled in your brainIt's getting cold outside and it looks like rainThe sky is falling and my heart is caving inSo, now the time has come to say the long goodbyeThe setting of the sun reflecting in your eyesDay after day after day the world will pass you by,You forget to rememberIf this is living, what the hell is living for?You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the doorI'm just a stranger now with an unfamiliar faceYou can't recall me at all,There's not a trace, not a trace, not a traceI don't know where you are and my world is crumbling inSo, now the time has come to say the long goodbyeThe setting of the sun reflecting in your eyesDay after day after day the world will pass you by,You forget to rememberI just want to talk What do you want?But you've nothing to say Leave me aloneI beg you to come Get away from meAnd you just walk away I have no idea who you are!I curse the day that your smile fades away, till then I prayA burning candle in-between and at both endsWith all that we've learned, yet we still pretendI just wish you could say my name againThey made the lock and broke the key,The culprit was the mercuryThe vaccine wipes your memories,Till you forget even how to breatheA tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceiveSo, now the time has come to say the long goodbyeThe setting of the sun reflecting in your eyesDay after day after day the world will pass you byI said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lieYou forget to remember it's time to say the long goodbye

Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep If I should die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take I'm not going to wake up today They've pulled my plug the picture fades And as my body decays Mold begins to fill my grave The smell of death permeates The silk within my coffin lays Go to hell! As they bury me now Six feet there my body lies Still feel like I'm going down I hear a distant wailing cry God something must've gone wrong And much too late I realize Go to hell! I saw my funeral that day I know who didn't show to mourn My judgment was life in hell Pillars of pain and thorns My only friend's the goat With 666 between his horns Go to hell! Place all your trust here in me Rest assured these things I know And as Charon sails the sea Your journey too shall end below Ah yes, you're all sitting ducks It's true you reap what you sow Go to hell! Now I lay me down to sleep Blah, blah, blah my soul to keep If I die before I wake I'll go to Hell for Heaven's sake

Somewhere there's a reason why things go like they do Somewhere there's a reason why some things just fall through We don't always see them for what they really are But I know there's a reason just can't see it from this far Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice I thought I knew it all I thought I had it made How could it end this way? I thought I knew Somewhere there's a reason why things don't go my way Somewhere there's a reason that I cannot explain Just like the change of season, just may not be my turn But I know there's a reason, the lesson's mine to learn
I heard the voice of redemption For me there is no exemption I started praying I heard the voice of satisfaction Needing me for benefaction I started pleading I heard the bells begin to chime Warning me oh lord Don't let this be my time Don't let this be my time I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher When nothing fits and nothing seems right Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you You saw me slide, you saw me fall We kept our pride through it all We started screaming When skies are dark, no sun shines through I know I see the light in you We stopped dreaming and started believing I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher When nothing fits and nothing seems right Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you I'll be there In my hour of need You were there always Now it's time for me to be there for you too Always I'll be there for you 
I'm lonely and abandoned Washed up, left for dead I'm lost inside the desert Of every word you said Like a nuclear reactor Or TNT I'm thinking about the times When you lied to me All the innuendo Caught up on your hook I was just a name In your little black book Ah, I'll get even with you I'm bitter and I'm twisted I haven't slept in days I'm lonely and I'm angry I can't make it go away I'm like a bomb that's ticking I got voices in my head I got a doll with needles in Wishing you were dead I'll get you back somehow That's what I'm gonna do I'll get you back somehow Your nightmare coming true Ah, I'll get even with you Ah, that's what I'm gonna do Gonna get even with you You better look behind you 'Cause there I'm gonna be I'll be standing in the shadows With who I used to be He's slightly schizophrenic Me and me and me and me agree That you are gonna pay For what you did to me Ah, I'll get even with you Gonna get even with you Ah, that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna... Ah, I'll get even with you 
In my hour of need Ha, you're not there And though I reach out for youWouldn't lend a hand Through the darkest hour Grace did not shine on me It feels so cold, very cold No one cares for me Did you ever think I get lonely? Did you ever think that I needed love? Did you ever think to stop thinking You're the only one that I'm thinking of? You'll never know how hard I tried To find my space and satisfy you too. Things will be better when I'm dead and gone Don't try to understand Knowing you, I'm probably wrong But oh, how I lived my life for you Still you'd turn away Now as I die for you My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name All there years I thought I was wrong Now I know it was you Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes Tell me who you think you are, who? I walk, I walk alone into the promised land. There's a better place for me But it's far, far away Everlasting life for me in a perfect world But I gotta die first, Please God send me on my way Time has a way of taking time Loneliness is not only felt by fools Alone I call to ease the pain Yearning to be held by you Alone, so alone, I'm lost, consumed by the pain The pain, the pain, the pain Won't you hold me again? You just laughed, ha ha, bitch! My whole life is work built on the past But the time has come when all things shall pass The good has passed away. In my darkest hour
In my hours of need, no, you're not thereAnd though I reached out for you wouldn't lend a handThrough the darkest hour grace did not shine on meFeels so cold, very cold, no one cares for me Did you ever think I get lonely?Did you ever think that I needed love?Did you ever think to stop thinking?You're the only one that I'm thinking of You'll never know how hard I triedTo find my space and satisfy you tooThings will be better when I'm dead and goneDon't try to understand, knowing you I'm probably wrong But, oh, how I lived my life for youStill you'd turn away, now as I die for youMy flesh still crawls as I breathe your nameAll these years I thought I was wrong now I know it was youRaise your head, raise your face, your eyesTell me who you think you are? I walk, I walk alone into the promised landThere's a better place for me but it's far, far awayEverlasting life for me in a perfect worldBut I gotta die first, please, God send me on my way Time has a way of taking timeLoneliness is not only felt by foolsAlone I call to ease the painYearning to be held by you Alone, so alone, I'm lostConsumed by the painThe pain, the pain, the painWon't you hold me again? You just laughed, ha, ha, bitchMy whole life is work built on the pastThe time has come when all things shall passThis good thing passed away
I'm running in quicksand Something's haunting me The guilty past I've buried My mind won't let me sleep I'll do anything for peace - I keep waking up A solemn oath I make Cross my heart please let me sleep - I keep waking up How much more do I take My head is talking to me I don't know what it needs But the loudest voice Is the one I heed Insomnia, my swollen bloodshot eyes Insomnia, awake till morning light Insomnia, stirring deep inside Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights I can't sleep - Insomnia I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up The madness I must tame My candle is burning - I keep waking up Both ends again today The whole house is creaking I know they're out there The things kept from sight I beg to the shadows I can't sleep Insomnia, footsteps on the walk Insomnia, I hear someone knock Insomnia, I wish it was a dream Insomnia, can you hear me scream 

The clouds prepare for combatIn the ever expanding worldOf nuclear attacks and global destructionAn invisable circle of silenceErrupts inside your abdomenEye to eye no one speaksWho will be more obsecureEvil lingers around usAnd no one seeks to destroys usPrepare for interrogationWith the immaculate nucleus With imminent imaginationsThrough the magic of fascination Do not go outside the invisable door'Cause nobody else seems to disappearAs long as all of us are thereThroughout the wear and tearOf dreams past and present Here we are on the planet EvilvillePut your head above the sky and detonateAll your phantom fears and all of your dangers that might killAnd why do I the power, howeverTo destroy our destinyAnd the power to overcome this buzzkillComes from underneath the earth Do not go outside the invisable door'Cause nobody else seems to disappearAs long as all of us are thereThroughout the wear and tearOf dreams past and present

Sitting up, late at night I tiptoe through the darkness Cold as hell, black as spades Aware of my immediate surrounding In my place I escape up into my hideout Hiding from everyone My friends all say, "Dave you're mental anyway" hey! Drift into a deeper state I stalk the cobwebbed stairways Dirt grits between my feet The stair creaks, I precariously sneak Hypnosis guides my hand I slipside through the walkways Sit in granny's rockin' chair Memories are whirling by, yeah Reminisce in the attic Lucretia waits impatiently Cobwebs make me squint The cobra so eloquently glints Moonbeams surge through the sky The crystal ball's energized Surely that like the cat waiting Lucretia rocks away

My life's on time but again my sense is late. Feel a might unsteady but I still have to play. Six to one's the odds and we have the highest stakes. And once again I gamble with my very life today. Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam. Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream. Your life is like a trigger, never troubled till you're squeezed. You crack a smile as you give the gun a squeeze. Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin. Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in. A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin. Load another bullets, now the second round begins. A couple grains of power, a couple grams of lead. A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head. Take another drink and raise the last bets. Think about my last words, they might be what I just said. A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail. Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill. A fraction of a second, do you lose or maybe still. Pass it to the left and collect your mighty kill. Add another bullet, the third round begins. Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in. Please, no IOUs no markers for death. Does anybody play? Anybody? Somebody? Anybody play? You, you! Next victim! You, next to die. You, you! Next victim! You, next to die. You, come on! Next victim! Your turn to die!You, come on! Next victim! Your turn to die!

People going nowhere, taken for a ride Looking for the answers that they know inside Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme Snow White's mirror said "partners in crime!" Don't they ever have to worry? Don't you ever wonder why? It's a part of me that tells you Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die Never, never, never say die again Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go Hold back, 'till it's ready, taking it slow Don't they ever have to worry? Don't you ever wonder why? It's a part of me that tells you Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die Never, never, never say die again Don't you ever say die Don't you ever say die Never say die Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall Children get together, you can save us all Future's on the corner, throwing us a die Slow down, turn around, everything's fine There's no need to have a reason There's no need to wonder why It's a part of me that tells you Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die Never, never, never say die again

Two hearts that shouldn't Talk to each other become close In a town much like a prison cell People speak our names On the street in hushed tones Oh the stories they'd tell If anyone would listen You come from a town where People don't bother saying hello Unless somebody's born or dies And I come from a place where they Drag your hopes through the mud Because their own dreams are all dying And when we walk down the street The wind sings our name in rebel songs The sounds of the night should make us anxious But it's much to late when the fear is gone I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you Where we can be together, I promise you I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you I promise, I promise There's so many fighting To get past the Pearly Gates But nobody ever wants to die or get saved Their intentions aren't that good And I can smell the asphalt That's their personal road to hell being paved And when we walk down the street The wind sings our name in rebel songs But it's much to late when the fear is gone I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you Where we can be together, I promise you I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you I promise, I promise I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you Where we can be together, I promise you I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you I promise, I promise

Each day my shortcomings pick my pockets My faults were letters carved in stone As meaningful to you as words written in water I'm left to walk this world alone In a broken mold they made me The black sheep of the family Worth less than zero my opinion And room temperature IQ I did something, now I'm nothing Always wrong with this or that Poisoned with fear watch it twist My measly brain mad Talk about me when my bac is turned Next time we meet it will be to late The memory burned in my ears of what you said And now I've got a recipe for hate. Taste it Dark clouds on the horizon Make it hard to breathe A walking mistake but every time I run away, I just come back for more The choice is clear I can quit And fall on my sword or light a fire To see who runs or stays And plays the confidence game Warhorse I'm feeling quite invisible I feel just like thin air The truth taunts me I see the earth below me I watch it spinning there Does someone, somewhere Out there hear me? Sentenced to walk in Purgatory My life is running down I can't believe what they've done to me I'm left riding a Warhorse A man without a country
I like the way that I make you itch And all the reasons I give you to bitch And how I make you wanna scream in pain And feel your life is just a losing game I like the way that you let me in The way you look when the walls cave it I like the way that your stomach knots And how you cry for it all to stop I like the way that you fool yourself And make believe there's nobody else I like the way that you stand in line And beg salvation from the empty skies Don't want no revenge Ain't no pay back time It ain't called getting even Here comes the Reckoning Day I like the things that you try to fake And your face when I see you break And that you say you will pray for me You realize you are prey for me I like the way you stay on attack No matter what, I keep coming back And how you try to hold me down But you end up driven to the ground

Auxilium meum a Domino The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not wantHe maketh me to lie down in green pasturesHe leadeth me beside the still watersHe restoreth my soul He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sakeYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of deathI will fear no evil: for thou art with meThy rod and thy staff they comfort me Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemiesThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth overSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my lifeAnd I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever
The mother of all that is evil Her lips are poisonous venom Wicked temptress knows how to please The priestess roars, "Get down on your knees" The rite of the praying mantis Kiss the bones of enchantress Spellbound searching through the night A howling man surrenders the fight One look in her lusting eyes Savage fear in you will rise Teeth of terror sinking in The bite of the she-wolf My desires of flesh obey me The lioness will enslave me Another heart beat my own The sound of claws on cobblestone, I'm stoned Beware what stalks you in the night Beware the she-wolf and her bite Her mystic lips tell only lies Her hidden will to kill in disguise

He had an unfamiliar face Complete life in disarray A simple man, power drunk No worries of living, no more anything Deep inside I've seen it rise Actions progress to no end Mirror, mirror please look inside Do you see the reasons that we sin Not one to be forgot Spoiled rotten, so they say Once burned, forever marked Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay Pressure coming down Down on me, gonna break Broken fingernails Digging in, scratch my face Nervous, like a cat Gonna jump through my skin Shadows on the wall Stretching out, grope for me Reasons, deep in me Let me be Let me bleed Set me free The reasons that we sin 
I had wrists donning slits Flowing constantly My broken body in a wreck I'm wrapped around a tree A crosswalk hit and run The finish line for me People clutter in the gutter Take a look and see No escaping pain You belong to me Clinging on the life By the skin o'my teeth My blood flows through the streets Deluge from the wounds Empty jar of sleeping pill On the dresser in my room My wet brain neighbor cranes His neck to see in time The white lights, a train Bearing down on me I won't feel the hurt I'm not trash any longer That that doesn't kill me Only makes me stronger I need a ride to the morgue That's what 911 is for So, tag my toe and don't forget to Ooh, close the drawer

I heard somebody fixed today There was no last goodbyes to say His will to live ran out I heard somebody turned to dust Looking back at what he left A list of plans and photographs Songs that never will be sung These are the things he won't get done I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man Just one shot to say goodbye One last taste to mourn and cry Scores and shoots, the lights go dim Just one shot to do him in He hangs his head and wonders why Why the monkey only lies But pay the pauper, he did choose He hung his head inside the noose I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle Use the Man Cryptic writings on the wall, the beginning of the end I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in my hand 
Now, one day I started telling everyone that "Killing Is My Business..." And I was hung like a martyr For "Looking Down the Cross" my "Skull Beneath the Skin" Prophesied "Last Rites/Loved to Death" my friends Then I started seeing "Bad Omens" in my head "Good Mourning/Black Friday," will I "Wake Up Dead"? If "I Ain't Superstitious" then this won't mean a thing But some crazy shit has happened since "The Conjuring" Not even close... To overdose! Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins A knife right through my heart, I am a victory Came "Anarchy" to "Set the World Afire" Pain of "Hook in Mouth," "In My Darkest Hour" Corruption of the world, "Peace Sells... But Nobody's Buying" Ignorant religion, "Holy Wars" and the dying "Tornado" nearly got me by the "Skin O'My Teeth" "This Was My Life," "Foreclosure of My Dreams" May the past "Rust in Peace" in "Hangar 18" And "Countdown to Extinction" just be a bad dream "Lucretia" said... 
Internal combustion Multiple personalities Terror inside of me A mask of silent agony Curse the falling rain The vortex of pain As medieval as Merlin A pact for power was made Lucifer in transition It's time the price was paid Scorching the domain The vortex of pain A telestic message Written in torment Howl out dirges Like the horns of Jericho Distorted faces Writhing in rage Walls of purgatory Tumble down Endless death The jewels of a crown

I sneak in my own house It's four in the morning I've had too much to drink Said I was out with the boys I creep in my bedroom I slip into bed I know if I wake her I'll wake up dead I wonder, will she find out? About the other, other lover... Diana Wake up dead, you die Wake up dead, and buried Wake up dead, you die Wake up dead 
As sure as the sun rises in the east Another gunman will come seeking my defeat Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still Will he fall like all the rest ending his days upon boothill I'm an outcast riding into town alone I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone I'm an outcast riding into town alone I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone As I ride into the sunset to take another town Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns I'm an outcast riding into town alone I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone I'm an outcast riding into town alone I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone A drum beats for me, it's louder every day The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgment day Life's an endless showdown never knowing when they'll come I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun The game I play has caused a lot of grief They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief I'm an outcast riding into town alone I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand I got wanderlust lost in no man's land I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land I got wanderlust

No hears a word I say And my prayers are never answered But you'll never see the pain inside of me Stabbing me over and over and over I trusted you and I loved you And you spit back in my face How could you do this to me? When will you stop trying to hurt me? I've walked a minefield for you A career in hell with you I have made it through the things Others would surely die just watching And the oath I take on this day Is to know that you will be repaid One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl Until then, until I see your world implode I wish you death and suffering Misery to spare Time to release your pain Face the last enemy I am the last thing you will know The last thing you will see I see your death surrounding me I know you, yes I do I know you When no words are spoken and please are ignored Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough? When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough? It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies A black cloud of indecision compromised your life When judgement has failed you When your own heart's impaled you Your wandering mind has destroyed you Will you ever know when? When you give everything and the feeling is gone All the giving is fake, did you fake enough? When you take everything and you stay too long When there's nothing left, did you take enough? It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies A black cloud of indecision compromised your life When judgment has failed you When your own heart's impaled you Your wandering mind has destroyed you Will you ever know when?

When someone becomes nothing to anyoneWhilst feelings have diedAnyone would know itThey set out stick and stonesThey say they'd crush my bonesI say, I don't get mad, I get evenBefore they doSpoils go to the victorI'm dead on timeYour time is going to come[Chorus]One day I'll dance on your gravesEven if you're buried at seaTill then, till when I exact my revengeI'll tell them, "you're dead to me"We're all just trying to hold on to anythingYou'd think they'd know that's what we're trying to doThese wounds are invisibleUnderneath the dirt I still see the scarsBut then when things got bad, we spread our wings and fly awayYou'll take all of your riches in the back of a hearseYour time is going to come[Chorus]One day I'll dance on your gravesEven if you're buried at seaTill then, till when I exact my revenge[Chorus]
Who'd believe with the way things are here We'd be going anywhere telling people how to live? Who's believe we'd spend more shippin' drugs and guns Than to educate our sons? Sorry but that's what they did I can't help but think, Someone's forsaken you and me Luck deserted me and the truth beat out my brains Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things I've stepped over many bodies on my way Thanks for the information don't need no more anything We are the damned of all the world with sadness in our hearts The wounded of the wars, we've been hung out to dry You didn't want us anyway and now we're making up our minds You tell us how to run our lives, we run for Youthanasia
