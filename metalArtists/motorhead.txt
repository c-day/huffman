16 years old when I went to war,To fight for a land fit for heroes,God on my side, and a gun in my hand,Chasing my days down to zero,And I marched and I fought and I bled and I died,And I never did get any older,But I knew at the time that a year in the line,Is a long enough life for a soldier,We all volunteered, and we wrote down our names,And we added two years to our ages,Eager for life and ahead of the game,Ready for history's pages,And we brawled and we fought and we whored 'til we stood,Ten thousand shoulder to shoulder,A thirst for the Hun, we were food for the gun,And that's what you are when you're soldiers,I heard my friend cry, and he sank to his knees,Coughing blood as he screamed for his mother,And I fell by his side, and that's how we died,Clinging like kids to each other,And I lay in the mud and the guts and the blood,And I wept as his body grew colder,And I called for my mother and she never came,Though it wasn't my fault and I wasn't to blame,The day not half over and ten thousand slain,And now there's nobody remembers our names,And that's how it is for a soldier.
If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man,You win some, lose some, all the same to me,The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say,I don't share your greed, the only card I need isThe Ace of SpadesPlaying for the high one, dancing with the devil,Going with the flow, it's all a game to me,Seven or eleven, snake eyes watching you,Double up or quit, double stake or split,The Ace of SpadesYou know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools,But that's the way I like it baby,I don't wanna live for ever,And don't forget the joker!Pushing up the ante, I know you gotta see me,Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again,I see it in your eyes, take one look and die,The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be,The Ace of Spades

Now your time has come a storm of iron in the sky,War and murder come again, lucky if you die.No way to rescue destiny, scream and curse in vain,You will never be remembered, no one knows your name.When the music changes then all is broken down,Mighty cities laid to ruin, burning to the ground.Murder is become the law; you cannot make a stand,Chaos rules the world, now mortal, brotherhood of man.You cannot hide the truth from me I know what's in your heart,Greed and jealousy each equal, all your days now dark.Mighty mountains fall in dust the world falls into hell,Faith in lying prophets, no one to lift the spell.Monsters rule your world are you too scared to understand?You shall be forever judged and you shall surely hang,We live and scrape in misery; we die by our own hand,And still we murder our own children, brotherhood of man.Blood on all our hands we cannot hope to wash them clean,History is mystery, do you know what it means?Slaughter, kill and fighting still and murdered where we stand,Our legacy is lunacy, brotherhood of man.We are worse than animals, we hunger for the kill.We put our faith in maniacs, the triumph of the will,We kill for money, wealth and lust, for this we should be damned.We are disease upon the world, brotherhood of man.

Nobody's mad like me, I don't know how to speak,Sometimes my eyes are open, sometimes my knees are weak.Nobody's mad like me, I like to see the skies,But I would rather see it baby from the other side.Riding on wings of fire, Nothing could get me higher.Nobody knows me, Knows what I desire.I know where the lightning strikes,I know why the vampire bites,I've spoken with the restless dead,I know the minds of rats,And the wrong side of the tracks,I hear the devils in my head.Nobody's on your side, Forgotten how to scream,Sometimes your eyes are blind, Sometimes you're in my dreams.Nobody's on your side, You think you're oh so smart,But you got a stone cold stone, not a beating heart.Riding on wings of flame, Never be this high again.Nobody sees you, Nobody sees your pain.I know where the black flags fly,I know where immortals die,I have heard the mountain giants tread,I have seen the death of worlds,I know the wizard's words,I hear the devils in my head.Nobody crazy like me, I'll make you believe,Sometimes I wear other faces, Sometimes I sit and grieve.Nobody's crazy like me, I know the night's alive,But you can't be too sure just who's on your side.Ride the electric storm, To the infected dawn.Nobody would believe what we have spawned.I know the way to hell,I know the padded cell,I have seen many heroes die.I know your nightmares too,And who sends them to you,The one who makes the children cry.I see the cruel insane,I feel their unknown pain,I feel the knives inside their heads.I see we are all doomed,I see blood on the moon,I hear the devils in my head.

This is a song for all you managers and agents out there.Are ya listening? Good!They take your money, break your soul,They say it's only rock 'n' roll,They think they're cool to wheel and deal,Without a thought to how we feel,They pick you up and drop you flat,Then tell you life can be like that,You blew it all the day you signed,Your stupid name on some dotted line,We hate the men, who make the rules,The ones who always try so hard to make us look like Fools!They say we need them it ain't true,The music's down to me and you,We play their games, play real nice,We gotta hear their dumb adviceWe hate the men, who make the rules,The ones who always try so hard to make us look like Fools!So many lies, they get confused,You start to feel you're being used,If ten percent is all they take,What happens to all the bread you make?Every day it gets a little harder,Just to keep on keeping on,Do we really need all this bullshit,So long now all the thrill has gone,We hate the men, who make the rules,The ones who always try so hard to make us look like Fools!It's so hard to make us look like you!
We live on borrowed time, hope turned to dust,Nothing is forgiven we fight for every crust.The way we are is not the way we used to be my friend,All things come to he who waits, the waiting never ends.We are the chosen few; we are the frozen crew,We don't know what to do, just wasting time.We don't know when to quit, we don't have room to spit,But we'll get over it, get back in line.Stuck here ten thousand years, don't know how to act,Everything forgotten, specially the facts.The way we live is running scared; I don't like it much,All things come to he who waits but these days most things suck.We are the chosen ones, we don't know right from wrong,We don't know what's going on, don't know enough to care.We are the dogs of war; don't even know what for,But we obey the law, get back in line.We are trapped in luxury, starving on parole,No one told us who to love, we have sold our souls.Why do we vote for faceless dogs? We always take the bait.All things come to he who waits, but all things come too late.We are the sacrifice, and we don't like advice,We always pay the price, pearls before swine.Now we are only slaves, already in our graves,And if you think that Jesus saves, get back in line.If you think that Jesus saves, get back in line.
Ya told me that ya wanted itI knew it wasn't trueTurned out to be the facts babeYou know what you can doYou can go to hell, you can go to hellGoodbye for youWrapped around your little fingerUnder you thumb tooYou know that I'm a singerI'm singin' just for youYou can go to hell etc.I guess I betta get movin'Lotta things I gotta doI realize it was a waste of timeTalkin' sense to youYou can etc.Hope ya got my little messageI hope you hear meI thought ya might've been the answerObviously crazy

When I was young I was the nicest guy I knewI thought I was the chosen oneBut time went by and I found out a thing or twoMy shine wore off as time wore onI thought that I was living out the perfect lifeBut in the lonely hours when the truth begins to biteI thought about the times when I turned my back & stalledI ain't no nice guy after allWhen I was young I was the only game in townI thought I had it down for sure,But time went by and I was lost in what I foundThe reasons blurred, the way unsureI thought that I was living life the only wayBut as I saw that life was more than day to dayI turned around, I read the writing on the wallI ain't no nice guy after allI ain't no nice guy after allIn all the years you spend between your birth and deathYou find there's lots of times you should have saved your breathIt comes as quite a shock when that trip leads to fall

So, Here we are in the years,All the past is a dream,Can't believe that I'm here,Now, Seems so hard to recall,Did it happen that way, Did it happen at all,Here we are, win or lose, good and bad, fast and lose,Here we are, black and gold, In another time.Dust, on a mirror turned black,The refection is flawed, all the mirrors are cracked,Strange how the glass seems to sing,But the words are like death, they could be anything,Here we are, win or draw, badly used, badly scored,Here we are, gone before, In another time.Look through the eyes of the mask,Tell me what do you see, can you make out the factsCould in the arms of the dead,I still hear them talk, telling jokes in my head,Here we are before the dawn, cold and black, death and scorn,Here they are, lust and grief, to oversee the crime,In the days before the plague, Never spoke, eyes like blades,Here and Now, Fear and grief, In another time

You only get a single chanceThe rules are very plain,The truth is well concealed insideThe details of the game,You can hear it coming,You can see it from afar,It's pale and it glimmersLike a faded movie starAnd out there in the castle,They're trying to make us scream,By sticking thumb tags in a flashAnd cancelling the dream,Can you find the Valium,Can you bring them soon,Lost Johnny's out there,Baying at the moonThe time has come for you to choose,You'd better get it right,Pulling girls with sharp white teethAre waiting in the night,But you want to really get some,It surely can't be hard,There's always trouble lurkingWhen you leave your own backyardUnderneath the city,The alligators sing,Of how the fool he cannot dance,When someone cuts the strings,Can you find the morphine,Try to be so brief,Lost Johnny's out there,Looking for reliefThat laddie looks so evil,And you know he really tries,But every time he makes a play,That battle compromise,And shall I find their underwear,From a store where no-one goes,She makes it big in dugs,On the strength of what she shows,And here inside the waiting room,The radio still screams,And we're shooting children,To murder all young things,Can you find your credit card,For god's sake make it quick,Lost Johnny's out there,Trying to turn a trick

I don't know what I like, I don't know what I am,I don't know where I'm going and I don't give a damn.I say the world is crazy, know there's no one to save me,I know a few things baby; I know we're in a jam.Black hole in the sun, I don't like the way we always run,And if your eyes are closed I better stay awake.You sleep like an angel baby, but I know you're truly crazy,And I think that we've grown lazy, waiting for the snake.You are a mystery, you are a bitch to me,You don't see why I stay why I don't turn and run.You think your life is good, but you're a babe out in the wood,Do what you think you should, sleeping with the gun.Black cloud on the moon, feels like the rain is coming soon,The way I feel tonight, you'll never see me break.You live in constant sorrow, and I refuse to follow,We might not see tomorrow, waiting for the snake.I think you know the score, I don't know what we're waiting for,Hiding behind the door, don't get us any place.I know that you believe, and so before the freeze,Before we feel the squeeze, before the monster wakes.Black death in the room, you sing a different tune,And it will bring your doom, the city starts to shake.I see the world is dying, you know I sure ain't lying,I see you pale and crying, waiting for the snake.

Ridin fast out of the sunset,Devils and horses advance,Thunder and lightning and honour,The army of saber and lance,Every man somber and focused,Each man looks to the fore,Death is the life we are living,Hungry for battle and war,War for War, saber in every fist,Where we were and are once more,Out of the dark and the mist,War for War. Determined for victory,Over the line they drew there,Honour the cavalry.Howling for blood, the leaders,Into the soon-to-be dead,Chopping them down like leaves as,The grass of the field turns red,We are a band of brothers,Disdaining the cares of the earth,All we have is each other,And that is all we are worth,War for War, the saber swings into the face,Shake the enemy to the core,Lost in the lust of the chase.War for War, we do not bend the knee,We are the worst of the best now,Honour the cavalry.Reaving and laughing and slaying,Leather and metal and blood,How could anyone do it.We did it the best that we could,Over the fields of corpses,Over the broken and maimed,Over the enemy's banners, beaten and trampled and shamed.War for War, into the shot and the shell,Into battle we go once more,The standard-bearers of Hell,War for War, the best and last of the free,Sworn unto Armageddon,Honour the cavalry.
