The day when the sun turns into blackI leave behind my landFor I have a mission sent from godSo I set out alone, not knowing right from wrongTo fight the evil one, my heart is made out of stoneSomething soars through the skyIt's the dragonfly!So I run like the windThis battle I have to winWe were chasing the the dragonWe were searching everywhereIn the chase of the dragonLet the gods lead us thereIn the chase of the dragonI sacrifice my blood, in the chase of the dragon!Wizard gazes through the crystal ballYou're the chosen oneAs dark clouds shade the silver lightEvil demons whisper in the nightYou will surely die!But I have no fear my faith is strongI saw my king stabbed by the beastStraight through his heart, poisoned his bloodLiving in fear, the only way, the only cureTo save our lord is to take my swordCross through the land and kill the beast!

In the dead of the nightAs the candles die outI'm watching her going to sleepShe has to be strongShe's left all alongI have to go out in the fields You're all I ever wanted There's just pain without youBut something came between us, My love Words cannot expressThe sorrow I feelI wish I could turn back timeTo where we beganWhere love has no endAnd you and me were as one You're all I ever wantedThere's just pain without youHear the angels cry in heaven, my love I'm scared I might be losing youAnd I don't know which way to turnI feel I might be losing youI can't live my life without your love The sound of your breath The smell of your hair The touch of your golden skin They keep me awake Through out every nightTo think of what might have beenYou're all I ever wantedYou're my life and my lustI could never mean to hurt you, my love I'm scared I might be losing youAnd I don't know which way to turnI feel I might be losing youI can't live my life without your love I have fought so many battlesI have suffered so much painWithout you to love and hold meAll of this would be in vain I'm scared I might be losing, I feel I might be losing youI can't live my life without your love I'm scared I might be losing youAnd I don't know which way to turnI feel I might be losing youI can't live my life without your love
How many years Can I accept what?s going on? So many tears I?m going blind But love is blind And I love you till the end of time Shall I wait and see? It?s up to me...You took my name But you wouldn?t share my blood It?s a shame off the road we ride Give me peace I turn into a beast On the edge of suicide Eat my heart of sin Can't you be the soul to give in?Leave your blame and hate Come to peace before it?s too late A life in pain Is a life we don?t deserveTake my hand Enough we burnedThe way you feel You know that it?s a shame The love we had Will fade away Eat my heart of sin Can't you be the soul to give in Leave your pain and hate Come to peace before it?s too late But love is blind And I love you till the end of time Shall I wait and see?It?s up to me...

We are the chosen ones, we sacrifice our bloodWe kill for honourWe are the holy ones our armours stained with bloodWe killed the dragonIn glory we return, our destination's endWe slayed the dragon!No more living in fear it's time to raise our king.We made it happen we're the chosen ones!Riding through thunder and lighting once againWe slayed the beast we brought an endNow we have left the kingdom of the damnedHeroes of the day, legends forever!It seems to me like a journey without endSo many years, too many battlesWe've finally arrived, now we're standing at the gatesHeroes of the day, legends forever

[japanese bonus track] Who I once was I do not knowStarting from scratch as Johnny DoeI have no name or numberNo family nor friendsNo one on which I can depend I'm no enemyJust a man who've forgotten his past I have no identityAll is blank, my memory's gone with the wind Seem to have lost my mind somewhereCan't seem to find it anywherePeople are staring at meWith fear in their eyesChildren are crying at my sight I'm no enemyJust a man who've forgotten his past, why all thisHostility won't you please tell me what I have doneThis witch-hunt can't go on anymoreCan't you see - this pursue is killing meLeave me alone, I'm not the NME, NME! I'm no enemyJust a man who is asking himself who am I no enemyJust a man who is asking himself who am INo enemy I'm your friendYou're no enemy - be my friend

Through endless forests in the night I walked aloneAnd there I found the prophecy carved in stone:"To find the cure for the man who is your lord,Use the magic sword"So take your horse and ride it fast across the landTo find the city buried deep beneath the sandSearch for a man who can bless your heart with steelIt's the key to kill the beastI'd give my life for my beliefsI will stay strong against the windThe time is right , I feel it strongIf you want the answers and you want to know them nowYou don't know where to turn cause they will bring you downListen to what I say and what I say is rightYou see, I rule the nightYou've always been left out, you're always on the runNo matter how you've tried, you never saw the sunCome with me now and you will not regretGot to be quick or be deadI'd give my life for my beliefsI will stay strong against the windThe time is right I feel it strongThe prophecyHunting the dragon to save our kingSearching for wizards is not an easy thingI'd give my life for my beliefsI will stay strong against the windThe time is right I feel it strongThe prophecy

I have worked for nothing, slaved in vainAll those years that I've been pushed aroundThey better watch their backs now, those who gave mePain'Cause vengeance screams their names tonight All of you sinnersYou better run and try to hideYou've all been dreamingSo you better hide to stay alive Marching out now, out to killThe rain of blood has just begunBlocked emotions now releasedIn darkness you will fear my name All of you sinnersYou better run and try to hideYou've all been dreamingSo you better hide to stay aliveAll of you sinners Can you hear me?I'm closing in on youCan't you fell it...  I will show no mercy you will not survive'Cause vengeance screams your names tonight All of you sinnersYou better run and try to hideYou've all been dreamingSo you better hide to stay alive
