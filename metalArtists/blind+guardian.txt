Welcome to my realmWe are both condemned to liveIt's a dark fate(I can hear your callsI can hear your calls)The eternal lifeI see it still burnsEach night I cry in painAliveThough the end appears my friendAnd blood tears I cryYou've searched and you've foundCut off your old friends handMy mind'sIn frozen dreamsThe rotten fleshOf bitter liesWelcome to where time stands stillNo one leaves and no one ever willCan't hold itIt burnsEach night I cry in painAnd blood tears I cryEndless grief remained insideAnd blood tears I cryEndless grief remained insideIt seems so clearlyBent the bowCause life in me is goneAnd a cruel wind's blowing coldAnd a cruel wind's blowing coldIn blameAnd life it shall waneEach night I cry in painAnd blood tears I cryEndless grief remained insideCut off your old friends hand
In fact it was close to a real falloutEverything's under controlThe speaker said with a serious smileBehind his maskHe knew the truthI'll bring a new age of better waysThe TV preacher saidJust pay todayPay todayWorld's dressed in blackOn earth's judgement dayAnd I?I know it can't go onForbidden signs increaseI'm sitting still at homeAnd watchingBorn in a mourning hallPale clouds feared the unborn childThen it grew up with growing plansOf suicideBorn in a mourning hallShadows left the fear insideThat Peter Pan will never reachThe other sideIt's frighteningExciting to sit at homeAnd watch the burning fieldsGetHypnotized by the TV snakeObey and work hardAnd feel no angerJust sympathy for the higher classThere's no chance in changing things'Cause I amBorn in a mourning hallSilent cries ran outWhen the cradle breaksBroken dreams were unheared onThe other sideBorn in a mourning hallShadows left the fearIn the new born childThat Peter Pan will never reachThe other sideAnd I'm a part of the machineA puppet on the stringsA rebel, onceNow I'm an old manOh, I know this can't go onBut the ghost called fear insideLames my tongue, my nerves, my mindEternal fall downSomeone cut the strings offI can't moveTo get back courageI've to face the truthBut not todayGoodbyeBorn in a mourning hallCaught inside a web called lifeThe only way to get out soonIs suicideBorn in a mourning hallPale souls built a frozen worldInfected brainsWill never reach the other sideThe other side

"You are now my guest, forever."
Pale faced, the innocent will drown in bloodMurdered with dawnDon't ever steal my griefIn the sense of green and dawn is goneBlind my eyesAnd I still can see through the mistThrough the barrierThere, a place where I fear the mostBlind my eyesMy love doesn't matter right nowI will bury my dead and keepUntil the endI won't give up(I won't give up)I crawl to the red fields of bloodThere's a graveThere's a roseDrift awayI can hear me saySoon you all shall be freeCarry The Blessed HomeNo one's left here but meAnd I will sing up your nameCall me insane I knowA hope of my heartAnd my soul to you sonSo pale turns the innocentAnd all I feel is painSuddenly I understand he's gone!Blind my eyesAnd I still can see through the mistThrough the barrierThere, a place where I fear the mostBlind my eyesMy love doesn't matter right nowMy love doesn't matter right nowCarry The Blessed HomeNo one's left here but meAnd I will sing up your nameDreamer, insane I knowWhat I fear the most I have facedAnd that's truthThe grey face, not innocentThough I cry in dismayI would finally care, move onIs there anyone here who knows how it feels to be right?Blind my eyesAnd I still can see through the mistThrough the barrierThere, a place where I fear the mostBlind my eyesMy love doesn't matter right nowMatter right nowMatter right now

[3:33] Every night I hear thunder. The shadow, can't you see? So one night I will follow. The dark side reigns in me.  (He) leads me to the dark plains. The end is near, I feel. But (I've) never seen his damned face. My hearts pound hard in fear.  Dead of the night, take me away. Dead of the night, he's looking for you.  A hundred solemn faces, They look at me and laugh. But if one wants to touch them, They glow through nothingness.  If I come to tell you, You look at me and laugh. I never found the doctor, So one day I'll be mad.  In that night I follow. No pain, no work, no more. He leads me on through the dark realm. My sense grows far too dense.  [Guitar solo] Dead of the night, take me away. Dead of the night, he's looking for you.  They will not take me easy. No love will come through death. I take them on and kill myself. And just feel emptiness.  Now you see them rising, But no one knows but me. So, don't try (to) follow a demon And wait for a last attack.  In that night I follow. No pain, no work, no more. He leads me on through the dark realm. My sense grows far too dense.  Dead of the night, take me away. Dead of the night, he's looking for you. Dead of the night.

Sad voices they're callingOur precious girl she can't be goneHow bitter this morningWhen daddy's darlingWent out and started her day Wasn't there a dream, last nightLike a spring never endingStill the water runs clearThrough my mindOn the field I can see a fiddlerThe fiddler on the greenAnd a sad boy I took him too earlyWould you mindWould you mindWould you mindIf I take you To be with youTo be with youTo be with youTo be with you The sun seemed brightThe air was clearThe air was clear A trick of light Turned red into greenShe saw the lightHer face was paleHer body smashedHer beauty's gone Isn't it a shameThe reaper saidHe is quite alone hereAnd still waiting for youOh I really did fail for the first timeSpoke the fiddler, poor old fiddlerThe fiddler on the greenThe fiddler on the greenIt would be nice...  Take my hand Just hold my handI'll take you thereYour pain will go away

[Italian bonus track] Lei non c'e'Ed il buio arriva,Io so che non tornera'.Della magia tutto cio' che rimaneE' un ricordo nel tempo che va. Come un'alba la vita puo'Coprire ogni bugia,Verita' nascoste tra le ombre,Sogni pieni di follia.Presto sara' notteNel buio che rimane. Poi di colpo tutto e' chiaroE la luce ritorna da me.Lei ha chiuso gli occhi,Ha chiamato il mio nome,Non e' mai piu' tornata da me. Frutto del buioIl tuo seme cresceIn un mondo di malinconiaQuando la luceEsce fuori dal cuore Lei non c'e'Resta il buio dentro,Nulla cura il mio male.L'alba e' sparitaSoffocata nel sognoIn un giorno che muore di gia'. La speranza si spegne gia',L'alba della vita.Di fronte alla morteIo sono rimasto solo. Frutto del buioIl tuo seme cresceIn un mondo di malinconiaQuando la luceEsce fuori dal cuore

3. Hallelujah [Deep Purple cover] [Music and lyrics by Greenway / Cook.] Hallelujah [3x] [Guitar lead] I am a preacher with a message for my peopleOver the world, scratching on the groundLooking for the peace that nobody has found I am a spokesman for a better way of livingLove is the word and it can be heardIf you are young the message can be sung [Guitar lead] Let me hear you singHallelujah [3x] Oh tell it to the man who's power is the sermon on the wallTell it to the man who says you can misjudge them allTell it 'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowdTell it on the field of war and hope you'll soon be justified There is a better way of life and it's not so hard to findIf you live and let the people in your worldSpeak it's mind I am the pupil who sells his life for freedomAll over the world and it can be heardIf you are young the message can be sung [Guitar lead] Hallelujah [3x]

She is goneLeaves are falling downThe tear maiden will not returnThe seal of oblivion is brokenAnd a pure love's been turned into sinAt the dawn of our living timeHope may cover all criesTruth lurks hidden in the shadowsDreams might be filled with liesSoon there will be lightPain remains insideSuddenly it seemed so clearAll the blindness was taken awayShe closed her eyesAnd she called out my nameShe was never ever seen again[Chorus]Harvest of SorrowYour seed is grownIn a frozen world full of criesWhen the ray of life shrinksShall cold winter nights beginShe is goneAnd I fall from graceNo healing charm covers my woundsFooled's the dawnAnd so am IFooled by life and a bitter doomTo bring you the end of the dayAt the dawn of our living timeHope it soon will pass byFacing a darknessI stand alone[Chorus]
I run through the dark fieldsOf the plainsReach level 99The pain cuts deep downThrough my vainHow will I break the iceWelcome to my realityDream foreverSunlight instead of neon lightHow will it beWelcome to my graveAnd feel the dream is overNothing can stop meI reach out for the topCaught in an old cageThe system failedBuilt up on liesNow I see that I'm aloneIn asylum's cageI'm left aloneRef.:I'm alive my friendI can feel the shadows everywhereI'm aliveI left the shadowsFar behind meAnother one is waiting in the darkThey say the system keepsThe last chance to surviveCaught in this labyrinthOf walls and lots of liesThen I began to understandThere's more above than iceTo reach the topI crept deep downThe answers given in the pastA sensless worthIn useless brainsMagic runesWithout a meaningBesides the darkThere should be nothing leftCaught in an old cageThe system failedBuilt up on liesNow I see that I'm aloneIn asylum's cageI'm left aloneRef.Outside they say death is waitingBut it creeps down through the shaftFinds pleasure in our helpless fearFills empty roomsWith morbid thoughtThey've locked the doorAnd hold the keySitting beside youWhen silent screamsChanging my mind and dreamsOh, it's never endingCaught in an old cageThe system failedBuilt up on liesNow I see that I'm aloneIn asylum's cageI'm left aloneRef.I'm alive

Just let me out of hereSpeak to meIt all would be easierI want to talk to youWho is that?Do I hear a whisper?Or do I hear a cry?Across the brown landThe stumps of timeOh turn the wheel and heal meSince moonlights fadeI'm empty - heal meI'm in search of the Lion heartI am ashamedI myself can't make itDrown UlyssesDrown here in the silenceCause down to Hades I've goneBut I cannot get outDown belowI can't free my mindSoon I will fade awayDown belowI can't free my mindSoon I will fade"Tic Tac" is the messageAnd the lunatic fearsHe is no moreSpeak to meIt all would be easierWhile I'm passing byWhat's that?Do I hear a whisper?Or do I hear a cry?Across the brown landThe ghost arrivesPick up my bones andTell meIs this the "Lake of Fire"?Hell?PleaseI'm in search of the Lion heartNobody elseBut the pure can save meDrown UlyssesDrown here in the silenceCause down to Hades I've goneBut I cannot get outRuins rule my memoriesI can't recall the signsInvite the deadThen silence struck my mindSilence is madness"Tic Tac Tic Tactic"Says the clockJust let me out of hereSpeak to meIt all would be easierI want to talk to youHear meWelcome to this sad placeAnd hand me what is mineI'm the Theban prophetThe dead and blindAnd from the sea you'll feel meThen you'll breath out gentlyLeave meI'm in search of the Lion heartI am ashamedI myself can't make itDrown UlyssesDrown here in the silenceCause down to Hades I've goneBut I cannot get out

Awaiting my last breathThe mirror calls my nameIt's showing me the wayInto the darkThe bridge appearsI jump into the dark sideAnd hear the voice it's cold as ice"Welcome to reality" Where am I now?Darkness surroundsCan't go forwardCan't go back I see planets dyingI fall into the lightA new universe awakesI'm a Traveler in TimePray for the lightWhere's the keyTo the gateOf a new life - noI search for deliveranceBut I cannot find [Chorus]Look behind the mirrorI'm lost in the twilight hallOnce I'll be back for a moment in timeThat's when the mirror's falling downTake me awayFrom the place I've beenTo another lifeIn another worldA sign of lifeSurrounds me nowThe bridge appears in the darkI'm freeI fly aloneLeaving the darkness now, forever?The memories of childrenAnd the wisdom of many lifesBurns deep in meWhere will the light go to?Where will the light go to?Is this deliverance?Is it the end? [Chorus]I'm back there's a new chance for meAnd all my memories are goneI can feel what's happening to meAnd the mirrow will burst [Chorus: x2]

Now the time has come for me to leave this landTake my charge with pride sacrificeRunning and hiding I'm left for the timeTo bring back the order of divineHunted by goblins no Gandalf to helpWith swords in the nightOh the last part of the gameDecision of death and lifeBlood for Sauron they'll call tonightThe final battle cryRunning and hiding I'm left for the timeTo bring back the order of divineThere exist no tales and hobbits are crying for allChildren of deathI have a dream the things you've to hide forDeliver our kingdom and our reichDon't fall in panic just give me the thingThat I need or I killDon't run away for what have I doneOh majesty your kingdom is lostAnd you'll leave us behindOh majesty your kingdom is lostAnd ruins remind of your timeNow come backOh majesty your kingdom is lostAnd you'll leave us behindOh majesty your kingdom is lostAnd ruins remind of your timeNow come backRun, run, runCries Cries in a dark landHear the voice it's cold as iceEyes they are watchingThey look for me but cannot findCreature is following no place to escapeMy last steps will find the right wayWhere's the future the call of the blind'Cause there is none to findWatch the sky you see no lightMy weapons burst with fearWith the howling wolves the nazgul will dieFor all Children of deathCries Cries in a dark landHear the voice it's cold as iceEyes they are watchingThey look for me but cannot findRun Run for the whole worldIt's time you cannot waitLost Lost in a dark worldYou feel the strange but cannot seeToo many battles we carry along from the warAnd too many frightens we feel from his lawFor so many victories we're praising so strongFor so many blood we've lost

Far, far beyond the islandWe dwelt in shades of twilightThrough dread and weary daysThrough grief and endless painIt lies unknownThe land of mineA hidden gateTo save us from the shadow fallThe lord of water spokeIn the silenceWords of wisdomI've seen the end of allBe aware the storm gets closer[Chorus]Mirror Mirror on the wallTrue hope lies beyond the coastYou're a damned kind can't you seeThat the winds will changeMirror Mirror on the wallTrue hope lies beyond the coastYou're a damned kind can't you seeThat tomorrows bears insanityGone's the wisdomOf a thousand yearsA world in fire and chains and fearLeads me to a place so farDeep down it lies my secret visionI better keep it safeShall I leave my friends aloneHidden in my twilight hall(I) know the world is lost in fireSure there is no way to turn itBack to the old daysOf bliss and cheerful laughterWe're lost in barren landsCaught in the running flamesAloneHow shall we leave the lost roadTime's getting short so follow meA leader's task so clearlyTo find a path out of the dark[Chorus]Mirror Mirror on the wallTrue hope lies beyond the coastYou're a damned kind can't you seeThat the winds will changeMirror Mirror on the wallTrue hope lies beyond the coastYou're a damned kind can't you seeThat the winds will changeEven thoughThe storm calmed downThe bitter endIs just a matter of timeShall we dare the dragonMerciless he's poisoning our heartsOur heartsHow shall we leave the lost roadTime's getting short so follow meA leader's task so clearlyTo find a path out of the dark[Chorus]

The lamb, the rose They don't exist The lamb, the rose They don't exist These are my last words I need to rest In fear and anger I'll lay down my head A faithless spirit in a broken man Everything is burning Rotten flesh keeps burning It's MY LAST SUNRISE in fear The grail's in pieces All the bliss is gone The rose has dried out And the lamb got slaughtered long ago The hope became another lie Like the nonexisting father god I'll close my eyes, goodbye Don't wait for me on the other side Everything is burning Rotten flesh keeps burning It's MY LAST SUNRISE in fear Don't wait for me on the other side Golgotha - had seen nothing else but A carpenter's death Golgotha - not more maybe not even that Suffer, grief and pain Have driven me insane Can't you see There's nothing real But you and I And I say goodbye Hear no evil, speak no evil See no evil, feel no evil Dream no evil, fear no evil Taste no evil, touch no evil... All I see and hear is evil All I think and feel is evil...

[4:08] [Hansi:]In the dark night (they) defend their missiles, Where it's the night we all die. Enthralling power, who searches to be masters. They play their game with your life. The burning fire comes around, the heat is onJust for this day, it's all sad blues.  [Marcus:]The East Sun is burning hard. See, your life is short. See the rainbow in the mirror. See the rainbow in the sky. See the desert in front of you. See the desert of life.  Standing in the cold rain, waiting for the end. See the shadows of the night. I have told you, but now it is too late. These are Symphonies of Doom.  [Hansi:]Feel the danger, this final battle. It will imply us all God's agony. The endless blitzes just blind your eyes shut And blow your life out to nothingness. Black shadows storming in the East, but you can't see. The liec has set that power free.  [Guitar solo] [Marcus:]The East Sun is burning hard. See, the life is short. See the rainbow in the mirror. See the rainbow in the sky. See the desert in front of you. See the desert of life.  I'm no sinner. I'm no fool. I have heard these chants before. I have told you, but now it is too late. These are Symphonies of Doom.

Out in the distance There's so much gold The treasure that I've found Is more than enough Far to be the hill we've to go Over the mountain and seas To the old hill Where the old dragon sleeps Blind in the dark dungeon's night So God please take me away from here And Gollum shows the way right out (Solo) I'm alive The dying dragon brought trouble and pain And horror to the halls of stone I'll take the mighty stone And leave the dwarves behind Ice and fire and forest we passed And horror in the halls of stone Trolls in the dark The dawn took them all Caught in the wood By the wooden kings' men But now I'm alone 'Cause I've made up my mind By the spell of gold The king under the mountain Will risk the great war Oh what a fool He's losing control So I am trying to find a way Blind in the dark dungeon's night Then darkness comes from the northern side And Thorin clears his mind

He was the wizard of a thousand kingsAnd I chanced to meet him one night wanderingHe told me tales and he drank my wineMe and my magic man kinda feeling fine He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fireAnd as he spoke I felt a deep desireTo free the world of its fear and painAnd help the people to feel free againWhy don't we listen to the voices in our heartsCause then I know we'll find we're not so far apartEverybody's got to be happy everyone should singFor we know the joy of life the peace that love can bring So spoke the Wizard in his mountain homeThe vision of his wisdom means we'll never be aloneAnd now I will dream of my magic nightAnd the million silver stars that guide me with their light

The field is lostEverything is lostThe black one has fallen from the sky and the towers in ruins lieThe enemy is within, everywhereAnd with him the light, soon they will be hereGo now, my lord, while there is timeThere are places belowAnd you know them tooI release thee, goMy servant you'll be for all timeAs you commandMy kingI had a part in everythingTwice I destroyed the light and twice I failedI left ruin behind me when I returnedBut I also carried ruin with meShe, the mistress of her own lust

Close to insanityBeyond the realms I've beenAt darkest placesI'm crying"The dragon flies"Something savageIs yearning for meI'm waiting afraid for the nightWhat will beI've lost myselfA few days agoIt's touching my soulAnd a vision of past dreams comes true Welcome to dyingI don't let it outWelcome to dyingLook to the mirror it shows what I amWelcome to dyingThis town must burn nowWelcome to dyingCan't You see the dragon's seed bears in meThe one who's been beforeMany times I terrorized this townMany times and here I start againNow I'm stronger and so coldCold as iceReturning is my destinyNow I feel it's growing up in meNow I feel it's burning deep in meI'm not what I was beforeCould I stop this dreamI'm a stranger to myselfAnd I cannot control Welcome to dyingI don't let it outWelcome to dyingLook to the mirror it shows what I amWelcome to dyingCan't you see the dragon's seed bears in meWelcome to dyingThe dragon's breath I don't let it out I'm a savageIt's too late for meThe other side's taking control and I knowThere's one way I can walk aloneOr the dragon will flyAnd a growing fear's all that I feel Welcome to dyingI don't let it outWelcome to dyingLook to the mirror it shows what I amWelcome to dyingCan't you see the dragon's seed bears in meWelcome to dyingThe dragon's breath I don't let it out Welcome to dyingWelcome to dyingWelcome to dyingWelcome to dyingWelcome to dyingWelcome to dyingCan't you see the dragon's seed bears in meSpread my wings and fly awayI spread my wings and fly awayI spread my wings and fly away
So let me out of itOut of the coldTo bring back light and hope for allAnd so if I could get you inJust for a little whileInto the songs of sorrowYou might understandWhere am I nowBeyond the dawn(Where) hope's turned to dustAt allImmortal love'sFooled by the hands of doomThat love means deathI realized too soonCaught in the afterlifeI've gone too farWhen sorrow sang softly and sweetThe air was filled with tearsFull of sadness and griefWhen sorrow sang softly and sweetI feel like screamingBut I can't breath inShall I wane right nowI will not leave thisWorld of livingTill she has saidGoodbyeOut in the coldI still wait for her callAnd her last kissIt shall be releaseI can't forget herHer face will not leaveFrom the depths of my soulI long for herSo I heard all about itHer voice's so clearShe's woven both themes in thereMoved me to tearsThe world shall hear this sad songSong of sorrow song of griefCan't change the way of his kindCan't change the way of her kind
In a white roomWith black curtainsNear the stationsBlackroof countryNo gold pavementsTired starlingsSilver horsesRan down moonbeamsIn your dark eyesDawn-light smiledOn you leavingMy contentmentI'll wait in this placeWhere the sun never shinesWait in this placeWere the shadows run from themselvesYou said no thingsCould secure youAt the stationPlatform ticketsRestless dieselsGoodbye windowsIn walked intosuch a sad timeAt the stationAs I walked outFelt my own needJust beginningI'll wait in the queueWhen the trains come backLie with youWhere the shadows run from themselvesAt the partyShe was kindnessIn the hard crowdConsolationFor the old woundsNow forgottenYellow tigersCrouched in junglesIn het dark eyesShe's just dressingGoodbye windowsTired starlingsI'll sleep in this placeWith the lonely crowdLife in the darkWhere the shadows run from themselves(I love you Itzel)
