Emptiness running through me Taking all that i am Leaving me this blinding mask Grasping for the wind Everything I've done Everything I've gained It all means nothing A mere breath has passed away Sadness I embrace Left with empty promises I look at myself and see the scars That are brought to me by this life Then I ask myself Is that all this world has to give The chase is over I am finished Stripped of every reason I cry out to You From my knees I scream

GoHow many years have we waitedFor a ship that never set sail?How many days have we wastedChasing a love that was not our own?I sat ashore and watched as oneHopeless wave crashed upon anotherWhile my thoughts ran to the hillsMy heart never, never reached the seaWith only delusionsOf an endless, endless journeyI am left with an oceanBetween you and meAn ocean betweenIs this your salvation?Is this all you can give?I will not stand in reflectionOf someone else's dream, yeahThe gate to my heartHas been well shutWith the splendor ofMy aspirations closed inHow many years have we waitedFor a ship that never set sail?How many days have we wastedChasing a love that was not our own?Is this your salvation?Is this your salvation?Is this all you can give?I will not stand in reflectionOf someone else's dreamIs this your salvation?Is this all you can give?I will not stand in reflectionOf someone else's dreamHow many years?How many years have we waitedFor a ship that never, never set sail?And how many days have we wastedFor a ship that never, never set sail?Is this your salvation?Is this all you can give?I will not stand in reflectionOf someone else's dreamIs this your salvation?Is this all you can give?I will not stand in reflectionOf someone else's dream
I've tried to find reconciliation behind the walls of those whose hatred burns.For I find it easier to reach someone who still feels,Than to make amends with passionless apathy.Where all lines are the same a portrait cannot be made. I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive. I need to know that feelings of discontent are strongerThan indifference for those too weak to stand. Like a colorless sky over a sea of nothingness,Hatred faces it's enemies while apathy strikes furtively. I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive. I need to know that feelings of discontent are strongerThan indifference for those too weak to stand.I need to know that feelings of discontent are strongerThan indifference for those too weak to stand Until our anger burns against injustice, we will createThe faceless by dismissing those forced to concede. Many of us have turned off the light outside, Erasing what exists beyond our front door.And for you I find it harder to reach common ground Than my most glaring opposition.But what about those who've lost the luxury of choice?Striving for identity, buried by our lack of interest, Souls marked as mere history.How much grievance will it take to awaken us? I need to know that feelings of discontent are strongerThan indifference for those too weak to stand.I need to know that feelings of discontent are strongerThan indifference for those too weak to stand= How much grievance will it take to awaken us from the comfort of our homes?The comfort of our over sized graves. I've tried to find reconciliationI've tried to find reconciliation
None of this matters, none of these wordsCommon and silent we will die in this worldWe've only spoken to those who agreeAnd without them we've fallen on deaf earsStand on conviction and you will walk aloneFor once I have stood no one will knowBut alone I was born and alone we must goIn my convictions I've found my own graveBut amongst the dead we all fade awayYet solitude is better than a life not worthy of reactionThere is nothing to loseSo we stand alone or join those who follow in miseryIn my convictions I've found my own graveBut amongst the dead we all fade awayFade awayStand on conviction and you'll walk aloneA voice is only a noise without someone to hearAnd without a crowd to feed that noise grows silentFor once I have stood no one will knowBut alone I was born and alone we must goFading back into an anodyne seaTo drown with all who've gone before meWe must goIn my convictions I've found my own graveBut amongst the dead we all fade awayStand on conviction and you'll walk aloneFading back into an anodyne seaFading back, fadingFading back into an anodyne seaFading back, fading away
I want to bring You all that is in my heart I want to bring You my everything But I've failed You so many times How can I stand here before You When I begin to steal what only belongs to You I am able to bring You nothing that isn't already Yours I am so ashamed of what I ever called my own Take what I have, take these broken remains What can I give You that You don't already deserve You laid down Your life when I refused to give mine
Reach inside of me Far beneath the encasing of ashes Bleeding red Still showing signs of life Remove the darkness Take me away A Stream of Hope destroy this corrupted cell Purification (Leaving me desolate in the face of perfection) Unable to hide I am drawn to the fire It is this pain that brings me likely do
Bound to learn the hard wayThis is the human conditionThere is nothing that can be saidTo stop us from making mistakesWhen I look to myself as a source of ending painNo matter how many times before I've failedIt seems our problems solve themselvesWhen we look beyond us to those truly in hellThe more I focus on myselfThen the more helpless that I becomeSo why not erase this point of view?My suffering is trivialCompared to those who know real agonyIt seems our problems solve themselvesWhen we look beyond us to those truly in hellIt seems our problems solve themselvesWhen we look beyond our sufferingMy trials seem insignificant nowWhy won't we look beyond us?Why won't we look beyond our despair?It seems our problems solve themselvesWhen we look to those truly in hellPersonal redemption cannot change the worldUnless we lay down our lives for those who still suffer
This blood turned into tears A broken heart runs my body Dripping forth until I give my life I have become a sacrifice It hurts me just to think of you I void the pain that is unbarring (To know that I take these sufferings from you)
I see them coming with shrouds to bury us allBefore we were, before we were born they shaped our livesLeading us into an unmarked grave in momentsMoments life could end so I will speak, I will speak while I canThis is my chanceMy time to stand(Bury us all)This is my chance(Bury us all)My time to stand(Bury us all)This is my chance(Bury us all)My time to standWe may fail alone but that is betterThan dying with them only to be forgottenI for one would rather suffer nowThan leave this life without passionThis is our chanceOur time to stand(Bury us all)This is our chance(Bury us all)My time to stand(Bury us all)This is our chance(Bury us all)My time to stand
Go! The Truth of my heart Is like a repressed tale A censored and silenced story Repression or restraint It is a delicate balance Between bleeding out what Will make me drown And closing in what I cannot afford to spill Either way, I must cauterize, cauterize the open wound I'm caught between the feeling Of being pulled apart Or stuffed into a cellOr stuffed into a cellAnd if these are the only options This will be always be hell Never ending Though I still may be breathing There is no quality of life So I choose to risk it all for you For you to be by my side I'm caught between the feeling Of being pulled apart Or stuffed into a cell Or stuffed into a cellA crowd is easy to deceive But now I am a patient on the table I'll give you the knife Cut away as you see fit Just promise me the patience To wait for me to heal  I'm caught between the feeling Of being pulled apart Or stuffed into a cellOr stuffed into a cellOr stuffed into a cell

Can you understand my meaning hidden in the roses around my eyesI want you to know how much it means to have you in my lifeYour love brings me close again in this instance when our worlds collideThe wire of eternity twists around usI can feel this river rising, moving up my backSome things never changeSome things never go awayI could never forget youAnd I will never be the same
You sat and watchedAs I nearly destroyed myselfNever had I felt so betrayedThat you would sacrifice my lifeFor no more than your comfortAnd now your love means nothingNothing to meYour love means nothing to meNothing to meYou are a cowardThe antithesis of a friendTake action beforeThere is no one left to defendFor I would have stood by youFor I would have stood by youRight to the gates of hellFor I would have stood by youRight to the gates of hellRight to the gates of hell

Control is dead in this blind world For we do what we hate Split from inside Betrayed by emotion We must look past What is in front of us Shadows are security They have become the solace Of my looking glass heart In search for certainty I no longer need control Take me through the fire Refine what is yours It is time to overcome this We must look past What is in front of us

The contingencies of a day unravel my sensesAnd now your distance is darknessMy hope has been beset by your absenceI decay from insideUnderneath it all there is still lifeDespite it all there is still love
Up here in spaceI'm looking down on you.My lasers traceEverything you do.You think you've private livesThink nothing of the kind.There is no true escapeI'm watching all the time.I'm made of metalMy circuits gleam.I am perpetualI keep the country clean.I'm elected electric spyI protected electric eye.Always in focusYou can't feel my stare.I zoom into youYou don't know I'm there.I take a pride in probing all your secret movesMy tearless retina takes pictures that can prove.Electric eye, in the skyFeel my stare, always there's nothing you can do about it.Develop and exposeI feed upon your every thoughtAnd so my power grows.Protected. Detective. Electric eye.
Did you ever see me or could you even see at allI looked at your cold white face, so still, so emptyYet I knew you were at restMuch more comforted than IWhat else could I find to replace who you wereIt was the carefree unrestricted love that you never meant to giveYou never had the choiceIt was your innocenceIt was part of who you wereIt was the comfort of a friend
I've watched them buildUpon these empty heartsFalse hopes of lossless paradiseGathering togetherThe dead hearts beat as oneStillborn comfort feeding liesThrough answers of self denialDivided between a dissolute selfAnd the sorrow of sincere devotionWhat is it that you find peace in nowWhere is your hope in this dark night
The sound of silent voices surveying my thoughtsRegularity defining perfection Neither sorrow nor contentmentWhispering emptiness, frail words collapseMy weight only stirs the groundHow long can I hold your hand as you walk over gravesYou search for tears of compassionYet find the comfort of winterReassurance dead like the falling leavesLosing hope in your unchanging waysAll of my strength cannot save youIf you are unwilling to help yourself
Exhausted beyond repair Stripped of all I had Forced to die inside Now I breathe a renewed Life I is now I see without my eyes If this is what it takes To bring me to my knees Then feed me pain until I realize I am but a slave Remind me of my need for You Remind me of who I am
Forever your eyes will hold the memory I saw your heart as it overtook me We tried so hard to understand and reason But in the one moment I gave my heart away The perfect breath where my mind lay beside me And all I knew is what had overtaken me With no explanation I am comforted by my inability to understand When I wake from this dream will you still be here? Will your smile still open my heart And leave me transparent?
I've looked straight into your eyesAnd turned my head for the last timeBecause I was scared to leave these walls in ruinLike the fate of those who trust in themselvesWe are alone and afraidI know you are the one we left behindSomehow we are the ones who are aloneYou are the one we left behindYou are the one we left beI will no longer turn my headI will never forget youYou are the one we left behindYou are the forsakenWe've built our confidenceOn broken dreams now left for deadYet we've been condemnedTo chase these dreams that never endI know you are the one we left behindSomehow we are the ones who are aloneYou are the one we left behindYou are the one we left beI will no longer turn my headI will never forget youYou are the one we left behindYou are the forsakenI will no longer turn my headI will never forget youYou are the one we left behindYou are the forsakenOur selfishness consumes usUntil the whole world is not enoughForgive the day that I erased, that I erased your nameThat I erased your name for it's the memory of me that will decayI know you are the forsakenSomehow we are the ones who feel aloneI know you are the forsakenSomehow we are the ones who feel alone
If I have been kept alive for one reason,It's to declare that apart from you I can do nothingThough discouraged by my failureI remember who I used to beLike a murderer transformed into a pretty thiefI have so far, so far left to goFrom shapeless to breakable I have involvedMy transgressions are evident to all who know meLike porcelain carried through a Downtown streetAt any moment I might breakFrom shapeless to breakable I have involvedI could say a thousand more apologiesBut to prove that I have truly changedOnly time will tell.From shapeless to breakable I have involved

We'll never have to die!Well, child,You're sweating and you're stonedThey've got to knock you downMakes you crazy all night!You're in never ending painAnd drink the devil's rainYou're screaming out your nameHellion!

I never wanted and I never cared beforeI never wanted and I never cared before(Take it back this is a new day)I never wanted and I never cared before(Take it back this is)How I long to regress to the daysBefore I took upon myselfThe obsessions of this world(For tomorrow)A day of innocence equating beauty(May fall)For tomorrow may fall(And today)And today is already gone(Is already gone)For tomorrow may fallToday is already gone(Take it back this is a new day)I never wanted and I never cared before(This is a new day)I never wanted and I never cared beforeI've grown tired of chasingConvinced I was in needAnd now the years I've spentOnly a slave to thisTomorrow may fallAnd today is already goneI will no longer adore toThese things that will never satisfy meI have seen my world changeAnd then go back to where it cameIn this vicious circle we areBrought back to life only to dieIn this vicious circle we areBrought back to life only to die(Die again)In this vicious circle we are[Incomprehensible]Brought back to life only to die[Incomprehensible]In this vicious circle we are(But without these barren obsessions)Brought back to life only to die(I am simply, I am simply free)I have seen my world changeAnd then go back to where it came
How could I ever go back Back to the life Where I lived amongst the dead Who have forgotten how to feel And become slaves to memory And wishful thinking But your love has set me free As you awaken every star That has been sleeping In the constellation of my soul How could I go back to live amongst the dead Those who imprisoned beauty I never want to leave your arms So I wait in hope for your embrace Illusions of what I thought was love Now I have clear sight to see That I have left nothing behind
Enticement, enthralling - fervent embrace Impassioned arousal A taste of blood wine, soft kisses fade awayFateful temptation, amourous aura Swirl and seethe in burning blissTo sink into deep rapture Ardent love profound Enticement, enthralling - fervent embrace.
How could we lose sightOf what matters mostTrying not to loveWhat cannot love us backAll we have is not worth living forIf we do not know when to let goWhat is this lifeThat we sling to it so tightAfraid that it will take from usThese fading sentimentsCan we die to live another day

All along it was me who changed.Morning now waits for me.What I have to gain does not matterIf what I give is all to You.I have seen the stars fullAnd the sun rise again,But You are yet to change.You are all that is worth living for.
We're born helplessBut guided by humanityWhat was compassion?Soon controls the way we thinkFamiliarity has left me desensitizedAnd inanity keeps deception disguisedWe are lost but keep moving forwardTo find the truth we must turn aroundHistory reveals an invitingSense of compromiseOur customs destroyedWhat was once uniqueTraditions started with useful intentionNow Subjugate those too numb to questionWe are lost but keep moving forwardTo find the truth we must turn aroundWe are lost!To find the truth we must turn aroundI desire to wake from SedationAnd begin to separateThe truth from traditionWe are lost but keep moving forwardTo find the truth we must turn aroundWe are lost but keep moving forwardTo find the truth we must turn aroundWe are lost but keep moving forwardTo find the truth we must turn around
Like a swarm of flies colliding with a moving windshieldSo are our lives on this never-ending roadI have left behind my mark only to be later washed awayAnd was consumed with the allure despite the inevitable decayWhen did the road that I'm on become my only home?When did this become the one place I truly know? (I truly know)A journey making us like weedsWhere the wind steals our splendorBut spreads it to the distant fieldsDespite our fragile imperfectionsYet shaking walls and wearing wheelsCan never capture my heart the way you doWhen did the road that I'm on become my only home? (my only home)When did this become the one place I truly know?I am missing what makes me whole
I fought who I am insideUntil I wanted, I wanted to dieInstead of finding balance I found hatredConsumed by failures and ignoring my own strengthsPushed out to sea without learning to swimOr stranded in the desert with no lungs to breatheWith no lungs to breatheI had almost lost everythingHow can I be expected to readily be contentWith a view of life that has rejectedThe basis of what has helped me to survive?And replaced them with preceptsRather than instructionFull rule is an illusion (illusion)All I can do is contain selfishnessAnd unveil what little power we may haveWith no lungs to breatheI had almost lost everything (everything)Tearing away my flesh before takingThe time to understand itA miracle may not be the answer(tearing away my flesh)When anchoring first on what I have(before taking the time to understand it)The ability to changeLike being stranded in the desertWith no lungs to breatheWith no lungs to breatheI had almost lost everything (everything)
This world was never worthyBut how can I call it unfaithfulEvery promise was fulfilledAs decay crawled from it's throatLike the dead rising from an open graveLips of splendor and tongue of deceitAll dying now as our fragile wrists hold only wasteLike those gasping for their last breathWe cannot hide there's nothing leftIf All my sorrow has led me hereThen I would cry all of my tearsTo have this chance againAnd know there's more than thisAnd know there's more than youLike those gasping for their last breathWe cannot hide there's nothing left
All these moments of painMust add up to somethingOur bodies have been trained to keep it all inBut our hearts still hold onSome say to release it, forget about your pastInstead we count the cost, it's part of usThat doesn't mean that we cannot move onIt's just a memory of what we once wereNo matter what it is we've facedIt's now part of us (part of us)We can overcomeWhy rid of fuel that can make us strongerWhen properly put behind us? (put behind us)And in the same way thatEverything good in life can be taken awaySo can all this painNo matter what it is we've facedIt's now part of us (part of us)No matter what we've faced in this lifeWe can overcomeTrying to forget is a burden we can never bearWhen facing trials openlyThere's nothing left to hideNew paths of strength come aliveWe can overcomeNo matter what it is we've facedIt's now part of us (part of us)No matter what we've faced in this lifeWe can overcome
We are all comatose. We are overfed and underUndernourished, yearning for something more.Never starving yet never quite satisfied. Carnal but without useful flesh or mind. YeahI am a walking contradiction that's found consistencyConsuming everything, all without producing sustenance.In the parallels we struggleStruggle to upkeep, There is a better way for us to be set free.From all it is we crave, There must be more to life than to simply stay aliveTo simply stay alive.We are not the same as I hope to show. There is a better way if we just let go.We are not, we are not the same. We are not, we are not the same. Let goIn the tension between devouring want or simple needIt's clear the only lines between the ones we preserve.We are not the same as I hope to show. There is a better way if we just let go.We are not, we are not the same. We are not, we are not the same.Let go, we are not the same.And in the parallels we struggle to upkeep, There's a better way for us to be, for us to be set free.And in the parallels (parallels) We struggle to upkeep (struggle to upkeep)There's a better way for us to be, for us to be set free
What is certain I have ignoredI have spent most of my lifeTrying to complicate everything that I believeSo that while paralyzedIn thought I will always have an alibiJust another excuse (just another excuse)To hesitate (to hesitate)Delaying true progress with passivityThe answers that I've foundAre all the sameThey uncover questionsThat still remainThe answers that I've foundAre all the sameThey uncover questionsThat still remainWhat is certain I have ignoredAnd what I know is simpleIf I am honest with myselfMy soul is broken yet easily fixedAnd what I know is simpleI must die if I truly want to liveThe answers that I've foundAre all the sameThey uncover questionsThat still remainThe answers that I've foundAre all the sameThey uncover questionsThat still remainThe greatness of us have become the leastI must be reborn to revive a heart that hardly beatsKeeping alive this hollow frameI must be rebornI must be reborn

I cannot make it without You All my efforts have failed So that I will cry out in the need of You Restore the strength of my Dependence Send me through the fire Make me pure again Everything I am I give it all to You In Your arms I wait I lay down my life I am nothing without You
I laid the night before me Unraveled the tangles of my heart All I felt was stale hallow air These streams of uncertainty They are collapsing upon my mind Torrents fill my veins until I burst With mistaken guilt and shame My battered bones Try to keep fighting Against the endless ocean of self defeat As time goes on Some months are yet to pass Puddles of ink Surround this tired chair All of my own sorrow has been spilled Into my reflection
You brought existence To what I never thought could be A world where eternity finds description I followed a dream only to be left in reality You reminded me of the unexplainable And then reshaped me by your beauty Knowing you has reinvented love in my heart The perfection of loves' true existence Experienced for the first time I tried so hard to wake from this dream But instead realized that I never fell asleep
This is what I am This is what I have become What is love without sacrifice My tears hold no weight If my commitment is only failure Each day I am born again to be A child in the eyes of love Repeating yesterday Drain me of my very last essence To form again what lasts
Your resilience inspires meFacing tragedies I will never faceYour presence is humblingTo think of all that you have overcomeIt took such little painFor our lives to coalesceFinding what I could've found in no one elseYou bring me through the darkness of myselfAnd show me that frailty can be turned to strengthSufferingPersistenceSuch sorrowYet resilienceFrom the outside I've deceived the worldWith false braveryYet you have taught me so much moreMuch more than I can ever teachAnd someday you mightNeed someone to lean onI can only hope that I'll have gained the courageTo be there for you in whatever you faceYou bring me trough (you bring me through)The darkness of myselfAnd show me that frailty (can be turned)Can be turned to strengthSufferingPersistenceSuch sorrowYet resilienceAt times I'm carried on the shoulders of a childI find power in your firm fallibilityMy source of hope is seeing that weak prevailAnd I'm better able to live because you're aliveI could not imagine a world without youWhere I looked you in the eyes and left you to dieSufferingPersistenceSuch sorrowYet resilience

One night opens wounds and words utter painThe truth cannot breathe a one in your soulYou've hid hearts and songs as long as you recallHis kind words just fall near your feetWith their last air, all they want done is to be heard in your sweet ears just once
[American Tragedy]
Take me home Imitations surround me You are all I want to see So why do I turn To embrace what will never last All my life I've tried All my life I've failed And one day I will see Surrounded on every side
The storm is coming and I have a choiceTo accept nature or lose my voiceShall I scream and plead for nothingOr build a roof over my head?I mourn the days that I wastedTrying to change what has been setFighting against myselfBefore I tear, tear out my eyesI'll just admit they're part of meI've labelled enemies who do not hate meAnd then claims friends who could care lessAll an unnecessary struggleSo now I know what it means to repentChanging everythingBefore I tear, tear out my eyesI'll just admit they're part of me (they're part of me)Instead of fighting against myselfI will open my eyesTo find who needs meI am awakenedI am awakenedBefore I tear, tear out my eyesI'll just admit they're part of me (they're part of me)I am awakened
I see who you are and who else can compare I meant what I said I promised to stand by your side Until the end That's where we begin From here to eternity We begin understanding It is our hearts that define What has meaning in life Some will ask how can this be but it Was you who made me feel
I see now, I see through the veil of expectation.I see now, I see that conformity is betrayal.Betrayal of those who are forgotten, yet vision alone furthers our blame.Unless followed by transformation, it is pointless to be given sight.Without the hope of our reaction, we overlook the purpose of our eyes.Now is our chance to breathe without tyranny, Released from the blinding of false light.(Blinding of false light) Now is our chance to breathe without tyranny.In weakness we are freedI see now, I see that conformity is betrayal.With empty eyes I looked ahead (ahead), With clarity I now look backNow is our chance to breathe without tyranny, Released from the blinding of false light(Blinding of false light). Now is our chance (our chance) to breathe without, without tyranny.In weakness we are freedYeahI admit my failure. Opacity has dulled my senses.Conformity (conformity) controlled by lifeless vicesOh, yeahCovetousness (covetousness) disguised as ambition.But now it endsBut now it endsBut now it endsBut now it ends, not with defeat but determinationWe are freed, yeahNow is our chance to breathe without tyranny, Released from the blinding of false (false) light (light).Now is our chanceNow is, our chanceIn weakness we are freed
For so long I have felt alone Content to live with unrest Longing faded into countless nights That buried my weary heart But you brought an end To this dead hour And meaning to a calloused life Held in your arms But too far from my heart These thoughts will carry me through The darkest nights While your eyes rested in mine I remember the way you looked at me And the way you drew me close With one deep sigh Scattering pieces of my restless mind Forgetting all that we have left behind
For so long I was deceived Enslaved by these chains Blinded to Your forgiveness If only I knew Your love Giving Your life to save me from this pain Broken and bleeding I turned You away Now I have seen the scars inflicted by my hands The Innocence spilled to save me Reaching to the hand that brought You this pain And now I am on my knees Crying the way You wept for me Crying, crying tears of shame Dying, dying to take away their pain I hear the screams of those who call from the grave Dying for me to take their pain
The only constant is change. The only constant is change. GoThe human heart is born without legs, sliding back and forth, And never once does it truly rest, unless accompanied by deathSliding back and forth.Even the strongest remnants of history, They have begun to crumble against time.Sliding back and forth.The only constant is change. Nothing remains the same.The only constant is change. there's only growth or decay. YeaLets goUnvarying scenes only found in pictures can never breathe life.For nowhere else does level ground exist, Unless it has been captured by a flash of steady light.Sliding back and forth (back and forth).The only constant is change. Uncertainty awaits.The only constant is change. There's only growth or decay, or decay.The only constant is changeThere is nothing that stays the same, From the foundation of our lives.There is nothing that stays the same. There is nothing to erase timeThe only constant is change.Nothing remains the same.The only constant is change. There's only growth or decay, yeahThe only constant is change (change)The only constant is change.
How can I bear this any longer? Arms stretched out only to hold separation Take me away I'm dying inside Emptied before you I will fight until the day When I will see Sight given to these blind eyes When will I be taken from this life? Take what is your You deserve more than my life
Just like the spread of disease, ya, ya,Debt and guilt or guilt and decree, The masters that we please.Yet if we seek help for infirmities, We are made twice the sons of hell as before.Reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, Only to be plagued by disease.Reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, Only to be plagued by disease.While religion tries to blame what we cannot see, I accept that part of the problem is me.It was never a sacred mandate to accept conformity, Through select revelations that we choose to believe.Another blind guide replacing divine eyes.Familiarity is the great deception, Disguised by authority, sealing out subversion.Whitewashed tombs have hidden the truth, For we unknowingly worship icons of ordinary life.Reach out your hand to find forgiveness, Only to be plagued by disease.The horrors of beliefs and customs, Camouflaged by commonality.Reach out your hand, reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, reach out your hand.I still believe that there is hope for us, But I believe we must look outsideThe sanctuaries of oppression That have brought our world so much painYeah,Another blind guide replacing divine eyes (eyes).Whitewashed tombs (whitewashed tombs) have hidden the truth.Reach out your hand to find forgiveness, Only to be plagued by disease (plagued by disease).Reach out your hand to find forgiveness (reach out your hand), Only to be plagued by disease.Reach out your hand, reach out your hand
We have all heard what we wanted to hearTruth that sounds right to our earsWe have all heard what we wanted to hearTruth that sounds right to our earsBut what wisdom is there within usTo live based on the feeling of our heartsHow many times has instinct let us downNever to be thought through, never to be questionedSay what you really meanWhen your ambition calls you, calls you?For what use is there in prayingIf you will only hear what you want to hear?We have all heard what we wanted to hearTruth that sounds right to our earsWe speak of fighting to resist this worldBut what about the battle within us?If we have chosen to live against the grainThen why are we all facing the same way?There is no difference between us and themIf we all blindly seek truth from sentimentsWe have all heard what we wanted to hearTruth that sounds right to our earsWe have all heard what we wanted to hearTruth that sounds right to our earsWe have all heard what we wanted to hearTruth that sounds right to our ears
White shutters enclose The boundaries of my heart I gold my breath Till the steady beating is shut out In silence I wait for what is real For I know the truth of my perceptions Nothing in life matters more than you When first feelings fade I will still be here
Shatter my emotions Take them all away Left alone to face You Now You know my heart Left only to speak what is true See through this plague of flesh With truth I say that I love You Yet my heart betrays me Be not far from me For these voices They must soon cease Despite their betrayal You died for me
Now this is who we areI am no oneI am no one's heroI am no oneFor we are not the giant menThat some may thinkYou are faithful when we are notSo I'd like to tell this story the way it is meant to beWithout the burden that's in our heartsNone of us would have ever found youYou are faithful when we are notYou began a work that only you can completeNow this is who we areI'll never know the answersAnd I'll always wonder whyNow this is who we areI'll never know the answersAnd I'll always wonder whyWhy we're given grace we'll never deserve?And a second chance that we will never earnFor there is nothing I can do to save myselfFor there is nothing I can doNow this is who we areI'll never know the answersAnd I'll always wonder whyNow this is who we areI'll never know the answersAnd I'll always wonder whyAnd I'll always and I'll always wonder whyNow this is who we areI'll never know the answersAnd I'll always wonder whyYou have let me start againI'd rather be called weakThan die thinking I was strong
Only through struggle have I found rest With a piece of me taken away I begin to understand Hollow out this machine like chest With its gears that turn to make me feel And assembled thoughts that fade away Remove from me This deception that I call love
Through this pain I refine Tearing me from within Screaming to be released but held fast by Your love Hold me here Break me until my face breathes upon this ground Outstretched with my head to the floor Spent of all my strength Relying on yours
What is this world, what is this we've createdIn the burdens of this life I cannot restThis world means nothingEverything we hold will pass awayWith a void of completion comfort will ever fadeI long for this wind to ceaseWe once held undying devotionNow dead to our thoughts, undefined like our love
I see no reason to try and be what I am notIf simple honesty moves me, then why should I care?Others may think I lost my poetic way (I've lost my way)But I'd rather make my point without confusionI have failed those who I love the mostAnd in the process become awareI have accepted there is so much that I don't knowI have accepted my limitationsIt is that knowledge that opens the doorFor greater understandingPerspective on what is still untoldI have accepted there is so much that I don't knowI have accepted my limitationsI have accepted there is so much that I'll never knowI have accepted my limitationsSorting out my thoughts, that is why I writeThough I reveal my weakness surrendering is remedyThese songs have helped me though my greatest painUnwound within me the disorder of my lifeI now see things for how they areEven if that is a harsh realityI have accepted there is so much that I don't knowI have accepted my limitationsI have accepted there is so much that I'll never knowI have accepted my limitations
Many choose to find their hope in the thoughts of afterlifeWhen there is none to be found right here before we dieSo I understand the feeling of helplessnessWhen we are just taught to wait here for deathWait here for deathWait for this suffering to endWait here for deathWait for this suffering to endWe are not forgottenFor a kingdom is offered beyond that of golden streetsWe can represent now what will one day be completeSimplicity is not a curse where strength is humbledAnd the powerless riseThis is a kingdom born upside-downThis is a kingdom where the broken are crownedThe "blessings" of excess are only a burden on usIt is a broken system where we just wait for deathIt is a broken system where suffering can never endSimplicity is not a curse where strength is humbledAnd the powerless riseThis is a kingdom born upside-downThis is a kingdom where the broken are crownedIf helplessness is our systemThen we're better off upside-down
We live in slavery to a past we cannot escape, And I say it's worth it to just start again, again. We've focused so long on ideals of freedom That it is this very belief that oppresses us.We all want to be free, yet we find ways to forfeit libertyTo our own impulses, to our own consumption. So I say it's worth it to build a new foundation, a new foundation,A new foundation, a new foundation, it's a past we cannot escape. This vacancy will take everything this world can offer.But what is control once we have let go of all we suffer? Once we've let go Yeah, when we've awakened to admit we are all enslaved,Then there is freedom in our choice to disobey, yeahOur creeds have become a justification (justification) To live the way that some see fit,(Justification) and no one is more hopeless Than those blinded by the scales of content. This vacancy will take everything this world can offer.But what is control (what is control) Once we have let go of all we suffer? We live in slavery to a past we cannot escape. So I say it's worth it to just start again. Oh,We've let go. We've let go. We've let go. Yeah This vacancy will take everything this world (all that this world) Can offer (All that this world offers).But what is control (what is control) Once we have let go (we have let go) Of all we suffer? We can't escape, we can't escape. We can't escape, we can't escape.So I say it's worth it to start again.

There are days when sorrow seems never-endingLike the countless roads upon which I've drivenThe price of attachment in pursuit of dreamsThat I so often can't seem to rememberYet there are days when beauty cannot be containedIt even crawls out from under ordinary thingsA foreigner, no place to goHolding on, making the mostOf what little time I haveAll the wasted words I saidIn all the cities that I leftThe last act of our precious playMust not close with regretI will not leave wishing I had done things differentlyThe moments I treasure are seldom the onesThat I planned forAnd if I knew where pain hid I might still let it goSo when the audience has run toward the latest driftIt will be my time to face the life that I have setA foreigner in my own homeHolding on, no place to goAll the wasted words I saidIn all the cities that I leftThe last act of our precious playMust not close with regret (regret)All the wasted wordsSome days the line between peaceAnd pain seems more like a blurBut I know with certaintyI can't leave wishing, I cannot leaveI can't leave wishing I'd done things differentlyAll the wasted words I saidIn all the cities that I leftThe last act of our precious playMust not close with regret (regret)All the wasted words
I'm deeply delighted by your glamourous beautyIn a magic realm we linger forevermore A glint warms my heart like sunbeams the earthImpassioned love-affair of eternal glee Lovelorn harmony, here to respireWe lust in ecstasy, forever combined Softly the wind touches our bodiesWe do breathe fragrant fulfillment Welter in carnal lust A glint warms my heart like sunbeams the earthImpassioned love-affair of eternal glee Lovelorn harmony, here to respireWe lust in ecstasy, forever combined
You meant the world to me All I have now is memories Your love brought joy to my heart You meant the world to me Tears of sorrow stream from my broken soul But I will see you again When this world fades away I will see you again
Each little piece begins to stack upNow suffering under the weight of my choicesAnd I hardly recognize myselfSomewhere along the lineThere stopped being lines at all (whispering silence)Whispering silenceThe subtle contradictionCompromise creeps inForgetting who I once wasSlowly changingWho I once wasEach moment seemed so smallWhen looked at by itselfBut it adds upAnd it has torn me downAll lines are gone (whispering silence)Whispering silenceThe subtle contradictionCompromise creeps inForgetting who I once wasSlowly changingWho I once wasSo close the truthBut still impossibleIt was never one thingAnd too many to try to add upFueled by faint deceptionConflict without acknowledging oppositionAll because I had taken pride in my hidden liesWhispering silenceThe subtle contradictionCompromise creeps inForgetting who I once wasSlowly changingWho I once wasIt was never one thingAnd too many to try to add upAll because I had taken pride in my hidden lies

If we chase acclaim in search forSearch for stature, Then our status becomes a vacuum draining. Opulence is a myth for there is no final rest.Change in circumstance only delays. The inescapable fact that we are downcast.In looking to the end we've lost sight of where to begin.Hope lies not in reachingReaching the end, If the journey itself is enough to bring fulfillment.Without conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion there is no final rest.Without conclusion, ShredWe are void of purpose before we start.For in chasing our destination the present state is sacrificed, sacrificed.In looking toIn looking to the end we have lost sight of where to begin.We've lostWe have lost sight of where to begin.Without conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion there is no final restWithout conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion there is no final restWithout conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion
[American Tragedy]
I can only imagine that wrath is being held outSo there will be time for us to be redeemedBut surely wrath is not being held outSo that we may redeem ourselvesFor I have seen the madness of those who died tryingBut is regret only a word that the living possess?But is regret only a word that the living possess?I long to see their faces regardless of the decayFor in the eyes of the deceasedWe would see hope in our last dayInside this dying worldFor there is still, for there is still beautyInside this dying worldFor what good is there holding off wrathIf we are determined to bring wrath upon ourselvesWrath upon ourselvesTo bring wrath upon ourselvesWe would see hope in our last dayInside this dying worldFor there is still, for there is still beautyInside this dying worldWe would see hope in our last dayInside this dying worldFor there is still, for there is still beautyInside this dying world
